# Unknown Unknowns (Unidentified Risks In Professional Portfolio Project)

> Notice: This Lecture Topic Task is open for edits at any time needed, especially whenever new unidentified unknown unknowns(unidentified risks) are discovered in our project

> Unknown Unknowns are  unidentified or potential risks that we are currently unaware of. These risks are challenging because they often appear unexpectedly and can negatively affect
>the development process.

>Identifying and  uncovering  these unknown risks early  can help us -the team-  prepare in advance, either to prevent them or to respond effectively if they occur.


  1.                            Brainstorming- What if Analysis:
     **The scope of the project is to develop a mobile application aimed at improving the connection between  students and recruiters.

     A. Technical Performance
     -  What if user profiles are not properly recommended by the algorithm?
     - What if the algorithm exhibits bias?
     - What if the app doesn't scale well under high user load?
     - What if there's a delay in syncing real-time interactions ?

     B. Security
     - What if a threat actor creates a false recruiter profile to scam users?
     - What if Students Professional data gets stolen?
     - What if someone impersonates a student?
     - What if a user's private portfolio content is unintentionally made public?

     C. User Experience
     - What if the users find it difficult to connect with interested recruiters?
     - What if users accidentally swipe (left or right) and cannot undo their action?
     - What if users want to review profiles they previously rejected?
     - What if a student wants to be reconsidered by a recruiter who rejected them before?
     - What if recruiters struggle to see the best candidates because of algorithmic issues?



     2.              Ongoing Discovery of unknown unknowns during the project
     To continuously uncover and manage unknown unknowns throughout the project, we will: 
       - Encourage Continuous Learning within the team to share new insights
       - Maintain documentation and knowledge management to keep track of changes
       - Continue using the agile development practices 
       - Scenario planning (e.g What if)
       - Testing: unit tests, integration tests,etc.
