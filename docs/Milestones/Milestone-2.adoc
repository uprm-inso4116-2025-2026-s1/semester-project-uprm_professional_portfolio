=== Current Situation, Needs, Ideas

==== Current Situation

Moving from school to a job can be tough for grads and companies. Lots of students feel like job hunting is cold and doesn't work well. They send out tons of applications and don't hear back. Forbes Advisor says almost 60% of job seekers feel like companies just disappear on them, which is annoying and makes them worried about their careers. But companies have problems, too. They get flooded with applications for starter jobs, and a lot of people aren't a good match. It takes up a lot of time and money to find the right people. This whole thing is inefficient and doesn't really show when a candidate and a company might actually be a good fit for each other's goals. It can be a pretty bad experience for everyone.

==== Need

Structural friction in early-career recruiting (lack of visibility, opaque communication, and operational overload) 
reveals needs that belong to domain actors, not to a platform. The needs are outlined below.

===== Applicant / Recent Graduates
* Be discoverable for roles that truly match skills, interests, eligibility, availability, and location.  
* Receive timely, transparent feedback about interest and status to reduce ghosting and uncertainty.  
* Ensure fair access to opportunities and maintain control over privacy when sharing work and personal data.  
* Obtain guidance to translate coursework, projects, and soft skills into recruiter-trusted signals.  

===== Employers / Recruiters
* Efficient triage toward candidates who meet must-have criteria and show mutual interest.  
* Rich, trustworthy evidence of capability and professional culture.  
* Predictable, compliant communication and scheduling to minimize drop-off and miscommunication.  

===== Cross-Cutting Needs
* Mutual-interest signaling before deep engagement.  
* Early expectation alignment on role scope, compensation range, work modality, and timeline.  
* Low-friction coordination for first conversations and follow-ups.  
* Trust and safety: identity assurance, respectful conduct, and clear reporting channels.  

===== Project-Internal Enabling Needs
* A shared domain description and a baseline set of requirements so the team understands needs independently of any system-to-be.  
* A consistent, ubiquitous language across analysis, design, and code to prevent concept drift.  
* Plans for requirements, architecture, component design, implementation, and testing to support whatever idea is chosen later.  


==== Ideas

We propose a three-part design focused on a personalized, efficient, and high-quality user experience. The foundation of this approach is a onboarding and profile system. The system would create two fundamentally different experiences based on the user, whether they are a recruiter or a candidate. The system will request only the most relevant information for each persona, such as portfolios for students or verifying company details for recruiters. The system will have an interface that avoids clutter and ensures the platform feels built for each user from their very first interaction. Making it easier and more inclusive without replacing the current infrastructure.

Once users are onboarded, the swiping mechanism would enhance the core matching process by moving beyond a simple binary decision. This means creating carefully designed cards that act as a information display. The profiles can have an simple view and a more detailed view. The key to this design is a hierarchy that is informed by user research and which surfaces key decision making data relevant to the user directly in the swiping interface to maximize informed matches without causing overload.

Finally, to ensure connections are meaningful and productive, the mutual Match connection and messaging gateway would unlock only after both parties have shown interest. Afterwards, the system would immediately facilitate the first message and it could include some kind of icebreaker or customizable openers. Furthermore, a dedicated inbox to keep users organized, allow for easy profile review, and potentially integrate scheduling tools, transforming a simple Match into a genuine gateway to opportunity.


=== Scope, Span, and Synopsis

==== Scope and Span

===== Scope
The project's scope is to develop a mobile application aimed at improving the connection between students and recruiters. The app will address issues with traditional job search platforms and career fairs, which are often impersonal and inefficient, leading to a lack of engagement and missed opportunities. The project will encompass several key areas:

* Domain Engineering: Analyze the current landscape of student-recruiter engagement, identifying pain points in job fairs, static job boards, and passive search platforms. The goal is to create a faster, more efficient, and more engaging way for students and recruiters to connect.

* Requirements Engineering: Define system requirements to enable students to showcase their skills, qualifications, portfolios, and preferences dynamically. Recruiters will also be able to display what their company is offering and looking for. Requirements will focus on improving job placement rates, event attendance, and reducing the time spent in the recruitment process. These requirements will be refined continuously using direct feedback from both students and recruiters.

* Software Architecture: The architecture will feature a mobile front-end with a swipe-based matching system, real-time notifications, and event integration. The back-end will connect with job boards, applicant tracking systems, career services, and on-campus event data to strengthen student-recruiter engagement.

* Software Design Process: The project will follow an iterative design and development process, beginning with a pilot test to evaluate performance and identify areas of improvement. User feedback will drive optimization of the user interface, swiping experience, and the matching algorithm.

===== Span
The project's span is focused on creating a scalable and user-friendly solution that streamlines the student-recruiter connection process. The app is designed to support efficient matching, real-time communication, and event integration.

* Specifics of the System: Students can create detailed profiles including videos, portfolios, and soft skills. Recruiters will also create company profiles that highlight roles, culture, and expectations. When both parties swipe right, they are notified of a Match and can begin communicating via chat or set up interviews. The app will also notify students about campus events that involve companies they have swiped right on, even if a Match has not occurred.

* Target Audience and Expansion: The initial span of the project involves a pilot test with a defined user base of students and recruiters. Expansion will include partnerships with recruiters, direct marketing to universities, and support for on-campus career fairs. Over time, the platform will expand to larger student and recruiter networks beyond the initial pilot.

* Methodology and Maintenance: The project will adopt an iterative methodology with regular update cycles guided by new technology trends and continuous user feedback. Effectiveness will be tracked through key metrics such as app usage frequency, Match success rate, recruiter follow-up rate, event attendance, and user satisfaction. The cycle of feedback, optimization and scaling will ensure the app remains relevant and impactful.

==== Synopsis

#The project aims to develop a mobile application that revolutionizes the way students and recruiters connect by addressing the inefficiencies and impersonal nature of traditional job search methods. By leveraging a swiping feature, similar to popular dating apps, the platform will facilitate dynamic and real-time interactions between students showcasing their skills and recruiters highlighting their opportunities. The app will integrate with existing job boards and career services, providing a seamless experience that enhances visibility, engagement, and mutual interest. Through iterative design, user feedback, and continuous optimization, the project seeks to create a scalable solution that improves job placement rates and reduces recruitment time and effort.#

[.underline]#The project aims to develop a mobile application that modernizes how students and recruiters connect by addressing the inefficiencies of traditional job search methods.# #It uses a swiping-based interface to enable dynamic and real time engagement between students presenting their qualifications and recruiters offering opportunities.# [.underline]#Throughout its lifecycle, the project will progress through several key phases: requirements engineering to define user and system needs, software architecture and design to establish the platform’s structure, implementation of both front-end and back-end components, and systematic testing and validation to ensure reliability and usability.# #An iterative approach will be adopted, allowing feedback to refine requirements and improve design over time. The final goal is to deliver a scalable and efficient application that enhances job placement success, fosters meaningful recruiter to student connections, and maintains user centered quality across all development stages.#

=== Other Activities than Just Developing Source Code
Projects are successful when coding is supported by planning, communication, and documentation. These activities keep the team organized and ready for future development.

* Although source code development is a top priority on this project, its success depends on several activities that extend beyond programming. Documentation plays a crucial role in keeping the project aligned, covering goals, requirements, architectural decisions, and detailed contributions. Well-maintained records make it easier for members to integrate into new teams and ensure stakeholders remain informed about progress, scope, and direction throughout the project.

* While the application is not yet developed enough for full-scale testing, it is still necessary to plan for quality assurance. This involves deciding how unit testing, integration testing, and usability evaluation will eventually be carried out once prototypes and code are available. In parallel, version control practices such as branching strategies, pull requests, and code reviews can already be defined so the team is prepared to manage collaboration effectively when development begins. These preparatory activities set the standard for a structured and reliable workflow.

* Project management and communication establish the general structure that ties everything together during this milestone. Setting clear milestone goals, assigning responsibilities, and documenting meeting outcomes help the team stay organized and avoid confusion. Regular communication ensures that issues are identified and addressed early, while planning for security, privacy, and future phases prepares the project for ongoing development. By combining documentation, early planning for testing and version control, and strong management practices with the coding that will follow, the team lays the foundation for a successful project.

=== Derived Goals
[.line-through]#The project’s goals go beyond building an app, focusing on connecting students and recruiters effectively while guiding team efforts and decisions.#

[.line-through]#* From the current situation, needs, and proposed scope, several goals appear that extend beyond simply building a mobile application. First, the project aims to create a system that improves the connection between students and recruiters by promoting mutual interest, transparent communication, and efficient matching. Students should be empowered to present their skills, interests, and career aspirations in a way that recruiters can trust and evaluate fairly, while recruiters should be able to quickly identify candidates that align with both role requirements and company culture.#

[line-through]#* In addition to these user-focused objectives, the project seeks to ensure usability, maintainability, and adaptability. The system should be easy to use and flexible, so it can improve based on user feedback and grow from a small pilot group to a wider audience. Security and privacy are also central goals, ensuring identity assurance, safe communication, and control over personal and company data.#

[line-through]#* Finally, internal team goals include ensuring collaboration, clear documentation, and structured processes for version control, testing, and requirements management. By clearly following these internal practices, the team can stay coordinated, reduce errors, and build a solid base for sustained success as development progresses, and the platform grows.#

#A key outcome of this project is the emergence of several derived goals that extend beyond the primary function of matching recruiters and job seekers. These goals leverage the platform's unique data and position to create secondary, significant value.#

#One major derived goal is the generation of actionable market intelligence. The matching process naturally produces a rich stream of data on skills, salaries, and hiring trends. By systematically learning from this data, the platform can provide a "Career GPS" for job seekers, offering personalized guidance on skill gaps, real-time salary benchmarking, and potential career trajectories. For recruiters, this intelligence enables strategic talent acquisition by identifying hidden talent pools, providing competitive benchmarking on metrics like time-to-hire, and predicting emerging skill demands. This transforms the platform from a simple transactional tool into an indispensable, intelligent partner for all users, with the data also serving as a critical feedback loop for the platform's own strategic development and product roadmap.#

#A second derived goal involves creating a dynamic bridge between education and industry. The data generated provides a real-time map of the skills employers need versus the skills candidates possess. This allows the platform to become a vital feedback mechanism for universities and bootcamps, helping them validate and modernize their curricula to close specific skills gaps, such as a lack of training in high-demand tools like Docker. For students, it empowers informed educational investment by highlighting which courses and skills will most effectively increase their employability. On a broader scale, this data can fuel regional economic development by helping cities identify critical talent shortages and create targeted workforce programs, ultimately building a stronger, more aligned local economy.#

#Finally, a crucial derived goal is to transform the job search from a black box into a guided journey for the candidate. The platform can leverage its collective data to demystify the process, providing unprecedented transparency. This includes empowering job seekers with data-backed salary insights that illuminate how specific skills impact pay, enabling confident negotiation. It also involves providing a realistic "mirror" to the market, showing candidates exactly how their profile measures up and pinpointing specific areas for improvement. By offering a "pulse" on typical hiring timelines and illuminating common career progression paths, the platform reduces the anxiety and uncertainty of job hunting. This shifts its value proposition from merely finding a job to becoming a trusted advisor for managing an entire career, thereby building immense user loyalty and trust.#



== Descriptive Part

=== Domain Description

==== Domain Rough Sketch

NOTE: This is an unprocessed collection of notes, quotes, and observations from the domain (student-recruiter interactions). 

- Student: "At the job fair, I stood in line 40 minutes just to hand over my résumé."
- Recruiter: "We meet hundreds of students in a single afternoon. After a while, names and faces blur together."
- Some recruiters use spreadsheets during the fair to jot notes about students: "Has Python," "Strong communication," "Not ready."
- Student frustration: "I never know if recruiters actually looked at my résumé or if it went into a pile."
- Recruiter: "We usually contact students weeks later, but many either lose interest or already have offers by then."
- Students often rely on school provided career services for résumé templates, but recruiters say they "all look the same."
- Recruiters: "We prefer quick ways to identify students with the right skills rather than going résumé by résumé."
- Informal hallway conversations sometimes lead to opportunities, students value those more than formal booths.
- Some recruiters only target juniors and seniors, ignoring freshmen.
- Student: "I’m nervous approaching a recruiter if I don’t already know about the company."
- Recruiters say a lot of students come unprepared, don’t know what positions are open.
- Student: "I applied through Handshake, LinkedIn, and the company website. Did they even see my application?"
- Recruiter: "We’re under pressure to find talent quickly. If the first batch of candidates looks good, we stop looking."
- Some recruiters mention re-hiring interns they already know -> "trust factor."
- Students compare the process to "speed dating", due to quick, superficial interactions.
- Recruiters complain they can’t gauge "soft skills" (teamwork, communication) in the short job fair chats.
- Student: "I wish I knew immediately if I had a chance instead of waiting months."
- Job fairs are often loud, crowded, chaotic -> recruiters and students both stressed.
- Some recruiters hand out swag -> students often remember the company by this.
- Students sometimes attend fairs "just to practice talking" rather than actually seeking jobs.
- Recruiters: "We’d like to pre screen students before the fair to save time."

==== Domain Terminology in Relation to Domain Rough Sketch

* Recruiter: (Actor) A user who represents a company or organization and uses the platform to discover and evaluate potential candidates. This term was refined from the rough concept of employer to specify the human actor, distinct from the company entity itself.
* Candidate: (Actor) A user who is seeking professional opportunities and uses the platform to discover companies and recruiters by reviewing recruiter profiles. This term should be revised as a candidate alludes to the user's primary role once a connection is made.
* Profile: The core digital representation of a user within the system. It is categorized as either a candidate profile or a recruiter profile containing corresponding relevant information.
* Swipe: The primary gesture of evaluation. A right swipe indicates a Like or expression of interest, and a left swipe indicates a Pass, which indicates a dismissal. This defines the core action of the system, removing ambiguity from the informal "Tinder-like" description.
* Profile Card: The user interface component that presents a condensed view of a Profile within the feed for the purpose of being swiped on. This term distinguishes the interactive element from the full Profile data structure.
* Match: A domain event that occurs only when two users have mutually Liked each other's profile cards.
* Connection: The persistent relationship state between two users that is established upon a Match. This term defines the context in which messaging and further interaction can occur. Moving beyond the transient event of the Match itself.
* Discovery Feed: The main application view where a user is presented with a “deck” of profile cards to evaluate. This term provides a specific name for the core screen, derived from its purpose.

* Student: A person currently enrolled at a university/college. In our domain, every Student is a Candidate, but not every Candidate is a Student. We use **Student** when context involves campus events, student portfolios, or coursework.
* User: A technical/authentication concept. A logged-in account that is either a **Student** or a **Recruiter**. We avoid using “User” to describe domain roles.
* Employer: The organization that a Recruiter represents. Owns job **Openings** and brand presence. Distinct from the person acting (Recruiter).
* Company (alias of Employer): The institutional profile representing the Employer in the system (logo, description, sectors, location).
* StudentProfile: Typed Profile for a Student/Candidate. Contains resume, skills, preferences, visibility settings, and **Portfolio** items.
* RecruiterProfile: Typed Profile for a Recruiter. Contains company association, role/title, sectors, location, and verification status.
* Portfolio: Evidence of work attached to a StudentProfile (projects, links, PDFs, media). Supports recruiter evaluation.
* Event: A scheduled activity relevant to recruiting (career fair, info session, meetup). Used for discovery, RSVP, and attendance tracking.
* RSVP: An explicit intent to attend an Event. Updates capacity and powers reminders.
* Notification: A system alert delivered to an account (e.g., Match created, unread Chat, Event reminder).
* Queue:An ordered waiting line (physical or digital) used to preserve turn order (e.g., at a booth or for processing requests).
* Opening (Job Opening): A role published by an Employer with defined **Requirements** (must-haves, nice-to-haves), location, modality, and timeline.
* Requirements: Structured criteria for an Opening (skills, eligibility, language, authorization). Used to assess **Eligibility**.
* Eligibility: Whether a Student/Candidate meets the defined Requirements of an Opening (meets / partially meets / does not meet).
* Shortlist: A curated set of Candidates selected by a Recruiter for next steps (review, outreach, interview).
* Interview: A scheduled conversation between a Recruiter and a Student following a Connection/Shortlist. Must avoid overlapping time blocks.
* Visibility
Profile exposure setting for a StudentProfile:
- **Public** — appears in Recruiter search.
- **By Match** — visible only to the matched party.
- **Private** — not discoverable; shared only by explicit action.
* Identity (UUID): An immutable unique identifier assigned to core entities (Profiles, Matches, Events). Ensures stability across updates and systems.
* Session: The authenticated runtime context for an account. Authorizes actions (swipes, messages, RSVPs).
* VerificationPolicy
A rule requiring a Recruiter/Employer to satisfy verification checks before certain actions (e.g., messaging, event hosting).
* Invariant: A rule that must always hold at the model boundary (e.g., no duplicate Recruiter–Student Match pairs).
* Factory: A creation mechanism that enforces Invariants when instantiating entities (e.g., MatchFactory ensures valid parties and uniqueness).


==== Narrative
[.line-through]
The domain concerns how employers identify, evaluate, and hire talent, and how job seekers explore and compare opportunities. In this context, the term “candidate” is used broadly to mean any person seeking a job, regardless of prior experience or stage of career. The observable world of the domain includes candidates with educational and employment histories, competencies, and preferences; employers with staffing needs and hiring calendars; recruiters who operate search and prioritization criteria; openings defined by requirements, number of positions, and relevant dates; application documents such as résumés, certifications, portfolios, and references; and recruitment events with agendas and limited capacity. Information circulates through common channels such as postings, professional networks, referrals, unions, and agencies, under rules of eligibility and time availability.

[.line-through]
A typical cycle begins when an employer defines and disseminates a vacancy with explicit requirements, for example minimum experience, qualifications, licenses or certifications, languages, and legal authorizations, together with job conditions such as work modality, location, reference compensation, and start date. Candidates discover these opportunities, compare requirements to their profile, and express interest. Reciprocally, recruiters may pursue profiles based on observable signals such as track record, achievements, work samples, or references. Eligibility verification precedes any advance. Based on that verification and perceived fit, shortlists are formed and, when appropriate, additional screenings are conducted, including technical or psychometric tests. Interviews are scheduled in non-overlapping time slots, held in person or virtually, and conclude with observations that inform later decisions.

[.line-through]
When there is sufficient correspondence between needs and demonstrated capabilities, the employer issues an offer with explicit terms and a validity period. Clarifications or adjustments may follow, after which the candidate accepts or declines within the stated deadline. In parallel, recruitment events concentrate interactions: an audience is convened, capacity is managed, attendance is confirmed, and participation is recorded. From these contacts, new expressions of interest and applications can emerge without a prior formal submission. Relevant information, including requirements, application states, evaluations, schedules, and event capacity, shows varying degrees of structure, which explains asymmetries and information overload on both sides.

[.line-through]
The domain is governed by stable rules: each search process ties recruiters to a specific employer; candidates and openings relate in a many-to-many manner through applications; applications do not advance without meeting minimum requirements; no person is assigned to overlapping interviews; attendance at an event consumes available capacity; and offers expire if no response is received within their validity period. Cyclical patterns also exist, with posting and closing windows that shape supply, participation, and acceptance decisions. This description reflects how the labor market operates, independent of any system to be built.


[discrete]
=== Scope and actors

The domain covers how recruiters discover candidates, evaluate evidence of fit, and make time-bound decisions. It also covers how students prepare and publish profiles and artifacts, apply to openings, communicate with recruiters, and respond to decisions. Primary actors are students, recruiters, and organizations. Secondary actors are career offices and third-party services that send notifications or store artifacts.

[discrete]
=== Core flow of a hiring cycle

. A recruiter defines an opening with role, eligibility, skills, seniority, location rules, and a clear decision calendar.
. Students prepare a profile and publish artifacts such as resume, projects, certifications, and availability.
. Students submit an application to an opening. The application freezes the versions of the artifacts used for that opening.
. Recruiters triage the queue of applications using quick signals such as eligibility, program, graduation term, skills match, portfolio completeness, and recent activity.
. Selected students move to screening and interviews. Interview outcomes and notes accumulate as evidence tied to the same application.
. Recruiters decide. Outcomes can be rejection, waitlist, or offer. An offer specifies deadline, compensation ranges or bands, start date window, and required actions.
. Students accept, decline, or ask for more time. The system records a final state for the application and closes the loop with both sides.

[discrete]
=== Key entities and relationships

|===
| Relationship | Multiplicity | Notes

| Student to Application | one to many | A student may submit many applications. An application belongs to one student.
| Opening to Application | one to many | An opening receives many applications. An application targets one opening.
| Application to Interview | one to many | Each interview is tied to one application and records stage, outcome, and notes.
| Application to Offer | zero or one | At most one active offer per application. Historical offers remain as records.
| Offer to Acceptance | zero or one | One acceptance closes the offer. Decline also closes the offer.
| Student to Artifact | one to many | Artifacts are versioned. An application references the versions used at submit time.
| Recruiter to Opening | one to many | A recruiter may own several openings across teams or time.
| Notification to Event | many to one | Multiple notifications can be sent for a single domain event with different channels.
|===

[discrete]
=== Invariants that guide design

* An application always links to exactly one student and one opening.
* An offer cannot exist without an application in a decision-eligible state.
* Once an offer is accepted, the application moves to hired and no other offers can be issued for that application.
* Deadlines are stored with time zone and source. Any change to a deadline keeps a trace of who changed it, when, and why.
* Interview outcomes and notes are immutable records once submitted. Corrections are stored as new records that supersede older ones.
* Notifications are reproducible. Given an event and a preference set, the system can explain which messages went out, to whom, and when.

[discrete]
=== Concrete examples from raw observations

* First triage by recruiters often takes less than one minute and checks basic eligibility and red flags such as missing graduation date or visa requirement.
* Students reuse the same resume across many openings. The application must keep the exact file seen during triage even if the profile later changes.
* Interviewers rely on a daily view named Interview Today with candidate, role, time window, location or link, and a quick link to notes.
* Offers require reminders at common timing windows such as T-24 hours and T-2 hours before the deadline.
* Career offices request an audit record of all messages sent to a student, including channel and delivery status.

[discrete]
=== Edge cases and ambiguity resolution

* A student accepts after the deadline because a recruiter granted an extension by email. The system records an extension event with the new limit and the actor who granted it.
* A recruiter publishes an offer with a deadline that is too early. The correction updates the active deadline and preserves the original as an error record. All related reminders are recalculated.
* A student submits two applications to the same opening through different channels. Duplicate detection flags the situation and asks the recruiter to merge or keep separate with a reason.
* An opening is withdrawn after interviews due to budget freeze. All active applications move to closed by employer with a reason code and a message to candidates.
* A student withdraws an application after receiving an external offer. The application state becomes withdrawn by candidate and future notifications stop.
* A student updates a resume after applying. The application still shows the submitted version and also displays that a newer profile exists for transparency.
* Recruiter reassignment happens mid-process. Ownership moves to a new recruiter while preserving the decision trail and permissions on notes.

[discrete]
=== Language and abstractions used consistently

* Ubiquitous terms include Student, Opening, Application, Interview, Offer, Acceptance, Reminder, and Notification.
* Application is the aggregate root for interviews, offer, acceptance, and decision notes. All changes that affect the decision state go through the application.
* Offer Deadline is a value that carries time zone and precision to minutes.
* Artifact Version captures the exact resume or portfolio snapshot attached to an application.
* Triage View and Interview Today are application services that orchestrate domain data into the screens recruiters use.

[discrete]
=== Why this structure matters?

This narrative ties the abstract model to observable work. The multiplicities clarify what can exist at the same time. The invariants prevent silent corruption such as orphaned offers or moving deadlines without trace. The edge cases show where business rules bend and how the system should keep truth and history. The language aligns with the rough sketch and the terminology so that design, code, and tests refer to the same concepts.

|===

===== Actions

*Candidate.*  
Before showing up, the candidate tunes the résumé and, if applicable, the professional portfolio to the role and researches the company. When it is their turn, they deliver a brief elevator pitch, hand over a résumé, and ask specific questions. In parallel, they submit applications through one or more platforms and keep a courteous follow up thread by email or LinkedIn. If responses stall or plans change, they may withdraw or pause the application.

*Recruiter.*  
The recruiter defines the role, its requirements, and the target audience, whether junior or senior, students or experienced hires. They publish the opening and organize their presence at fairs or meetups. During screening, they jot quick notes and tags about candidates, run prescreens, invite candidates to interviews, and keep communication moving. When the first batch covers the need, sourcing stops. Known talent such as former interns is often prioritized because the risk is lower.

*System/Institution.*  
Supports communication and record keeping. It announces events and openings, records check-ins, centralizes résumés and applications, deduplicates multichannel entries, and preserves traceability through versioning and logs. It also provides tools for note taking and auditable prescreen rules.

*Third parties.*  
Referees and background check providers supply information that helps corroborate the hiring decision when appropriate.

===== Behaviors

*In person recruiting flow.*  
The process moves from announcement to attendance, then queuing, a brief conversation at the booth, and follow up. Noise, crowding, and time pressure push interactions toward quick impressions and coarse screening. Soft skills are hard to judge in under a minute.

*Multichannel applications and unclear status.*  
Candidates often apply through several portals and by referral. Without a single source of truth, duplicate records and uncertain statuses appear, which confuses both sides and slows review.

*Fast screening and prioritization.*  
To manage volume, recruiters rely on simple heuristics such as year, visible skills, and seniority, as well as rule based filters. Throughput improves, but the risk of overlooking strong profiles increases.

*Communication delay and attrition.*  
If outreach arrives weeks after the first contact, interest declines and other processes advance. Early signals and timely touchpoints reduce drop off.

*Stopping after the first promising group.*  
When the initial cohort seems sufficient, active sourcing pauses. The window for new applicants narrows and the range of options can shrink.

*Rehiring based on trust.*  
People already known to the team, such as former interns, are often prioritized because their performance is validated. Time to hire shortens and uncertainty decreases compared with external candidates.

*Uneven candidate preparation.*  
Some arrive with generic résumés or limited knowledge of the company, while others attend mainly to practice and build confidence. The level of preparation shapes the quality of the pitch and the impression left.

*Informal networking that converts well.*  
Unplanned conversations away from the booth allow calmer and more genuine exchanges that sometimes outperform the formal interaction.

*Notes as the memory of the process.*  
With many brief encounters, concise notes and tags become essential to remember people and make decisions. Consistent record keeping improves later review and shortlist quality.

*Brand recall from presence and giveaways.*  
A well run booth and thoughtful materials strengthen memory of the employer and help reengage candidates after the event.

==== Function Signatures

The system's core domain logic is defined by a set of function signatures that outline operations, inputs, outputs, and potential failure states. At its foundation, user interaction is governed by swiping and matching mechanics.

* `getNextProfile : UserId -> Option ProfileCard`  
  Fetches the next profile card from a user's personalized deck. Returns `None` if the deck is empty.

* `processSwipe : UserId >< ProfileId >< SwipeDirection -> Result<Unit, Error>`  
  Records a swipe (Like or Pass) for a given profile. Returns a result indicating success or an error.

* `checkForMatch : UserId >< ProfileId -> Option Match`  
  Determines whether a swipe action resulted in a mutual Like, returning a `Match` if successful.

Once a successful Match is established, profile and connection management functions handle communication setup:

* `createConnection : Match -> Connection`  
  Creates a persistent connection between two matched users, establishing a channel for communication.

* `sendMessage : ConnectionId >< UserId >< MessageContent -> Result<Message, Error>`  
  Sends a message within a connection. Returns the message if successful, or an error for invalid requests.

* `getProfile : UserId -> Result<Profile, Error>`  
  Retrieves a full user profile (as opposed to the condensed profile card), with permission checks applied.

Session and state management functions ensure authentication and preparation of user data:

* `initializeUserSession : UserCredentials -> Result<UserSession, Error>`  
  Authenticates a user's credentials. If successful, returns a session containing identity and role.

* `getUserDeck : UserId -> Deck`  
  Builds a user's deck of profile cards, dynamically generated using the platform's matching algorithm and the user’s past activity and preferences.

==== Domain Requirements

The system must uniquely identify every candidate, every recruiter, every employer, and every event organizer, while distinguishing natural persons from institutional profiles when the entity is a company or an organizer, and it must record the role performed by each entity in every interaction together with the time and the context of that role. The system must represent every opening with explicit requirements including minimum experience, qualifications, certifications, languages, legal authorizations, work modality, location, compensation range, and start date, must record the number of positions available for each opening, must link every opening to its responsible employer, and must allow requirement updates while preserving a complete history of changes. The system must represent each candidate profile with education, work history, competencies, certifications, portfolios, and verifiable references, must allow attaching documents to the profile preserving issue date, validity, and verification status, and must record candidate preferences such as areas of interest, desired location, and work modality. The system must represent recruiting events with name, organizer, venue, agenda, date, and capacity, must represent company booths or tables within each event and their relation to the promoted openings, must register attendance and arrival of candidates and recruiters, and must enforce registration rules and capacity limits defined by the organizer. The system must model queues in front of booths or tables preserving a first come first served order, must allow limiting the duration of each turn, must register the closure of each turn by staff, and must prevent assigning turns that exceed the declared capacity of a booth or of a time block. The system must allow candidates and recruiters to express interest in openings or in profiles and must record when the expression is reciprocal, must create a Match when both sides express positive interest and must preserve the date and the context of that event, must allow recruiters to define shortlisting criteria based on requirements and evidence and must register the decision with its justification, and must allow candidates to withdraw their interest and update any pending Matches. The system must represent availability of candidates and recruiters through calendars and time blocks, must schedule interviews only on valid Matches, must prevent double booking of the same block, and must register interview outcomes with clear states such as continues in process, rejected, or offer extended together with the date and the responsible party. The system must allow message exchanges between candidate and recruiter only when there is a valid Match or an explicit permission from the candidate, must register candidate consent for sharing information with an employer or with an organizer, and must allow revocation of that consent. The system must compute and display the degree of requirement fulfillment for each candidate with categories such as meets, partially meets, or does not meet, must prevent practices that alter queue order without a rule defined by the event such as priority for confirmed appointments, and must keep an auditable record of shortlisting and rejection decisions together with their criteria. The system must notify candidates and recruiters when a Match is created, when an interview is confirmed, and when changes to opening requirements affect eligibility, and it must notify candidates about recruiting events related to employers or openings in which they have shown interest. The system must record domain metrics such as Match rate, queue waiting time, average turn duration, follow up rate after Matches, and event attendance, and it must support funnel analysis from expression of interest to offer extended in order to identify bottlenecks. The system must prevent the creation of Matches when any party does not exist or when the opening is closed, must keep the link between every document and the identity of the person or the entity that provided it together with its validation status, and must preserve the full state history of each opening and of each candidacy from origin to closure.

==== Interface Requirements

The first requirement is that the system must provide a means for a new user identifying as a recruiter to initialize their internal recruiter profile representation. This initialization shall be performed by the recruiter via a structured form presented during the registration process. The form must include fields to capture the shared phenomena of company name, professional email address, and job role. The initialisation process shall include a validation step where a confirmation email is sent to the provided professional email address. The internal profile representation shall not be considered active until this validation is complete.

Secondly, the system must provide a means to update the internal representation of a student's skills when these phenomena change in the domain such as adding new projects. The student shall be able to initiate an update via an edit profile screen. The system shall provide input fields and controls to allow the student to modify their skill set. The internal representation shall be updated immediately upon the student saving the changes.
The next requirement is that the internal event of a Match must be communicated to the involved users to reflect this new shared state in the domain. The system shall present a visual notification to both users immediately upon the Match being recorded in the system. This interface must provide a clear indication of who the Match is with and shall include a prominent means to initiate communication, thereby enabling the next domain action.

The system must provide a means for an authorized recruiter to correct the internal representation of their company's information if it was initially entered incorrectly or becomes outdated. Recruiters shall have access to a company profile management screen. This interface shall allow them to edit fields such as company description and website URL. The system shall log all such changes. The company name field shall be immutable through this interface after the initial validation to ensure traceability. Changes to the company name must be handled by a separate administrative process to maintain data integrity.

Lastly, the internal system state must be updated to reflect a user's swipe action on a profile card. The user's gesture shall be the sole initiating action. The system shall immediately update the internal state to record this decision and remove the presented profile card from the user's current deck. No explicit save or confirm action is required; the gesture itself is the interface event.


==== Machine Requirements

This section specifies the hardware, software, and environmental requirements to develop, test, and deploy the Professional Portfolio application. These requirements are tailored to the technologies chosen for the project: Flutter/Dart for the mobile frontend, cloud services (Firebase, AWS, or Azure) for backend support, and SQLite for local storage.

**Hardware Requirements**

*Developer Workstations*  
  - Minimum: Dual-core processor (Intel i5/AMD equivalent), 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD.  
  - Recommended: Quad-core processor, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD.  

*Mobile Devices for Testing*  
  - Android: Devices running Android 10.0+ with at least 3 GB RAM.  
  - iOS: Devices running iOS 15+ (e.g., iPhone 11 or newer).  

*Servers / Cloud Hosting*  
  - Minimum: 2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM, 50 GB storage.  
  - Recommended: 4 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM, 100 GB storage with autoscaling enabled on cloud platforms.

**Software Requirements**

*Development Tools*  
  - Flutter SDK (latest stable release).  
  - Dart SDK (bundled with Flutter).  
  - Android Studio for Android builds and emulators.  
  - Xcode for iOS builds and testing.  
  - Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.  

*Programming Environment*  
  - Dart as the primary programming language.  
  - Flutter framework for cross-platform UI and logic.  
  - Emulator/simulator tools for Android and iOS.  

*Database and Services*  
  - SQLite for local offline storage.  
  - Firebase, AWS, or Azure for authentication, notifications, and backend integration.

**Environmental Requirements**

*Operating Systems*  
  - Developer machines: Windows 10/11 or macOS Monterey+.  
  - Deployment targets: Android 10+ and iOS 15+.  

*Network*  
  - Stable broadband connection (≥10 Mbps) for syncing repositories, package downloads, and testing cloud-based services.  
  - All client-server communication must use HTTPS.  

*Other Constraints*  
  - Developers must test on both Android and iOS environments.  
  - Compliance with Google Play Store and Apple App Store distribution guidelines.  
  - External dependencies must be compatible with the current Flutter LTS release.  

**Rationale and Validation**

The requirements ensure that all contributors can work effectively while keeping compatibility with the targeted platforms. Minimum specifications guarantee accessibility across the team, while recommended specifications support smoother emulator performance and integration with cloud services. Each requirement is measurable (e.g., OS versions, RAM, network speed) and traceable to the technologies already adopted by the project.


=== Implementation

==== Selected Fragments of the Implementation

The implementation fragments presented here illustrate how the proposed system realizes its core concept-rofiles, swiping, matching, messaging, and event participatio-ithin the domain of student-recruiter interactions. They are not exhaustive; instead, they show how selected components are translated into concrete structures and operations.

===== Domain-Centric Function Signatures

In Flutter/Dart, we express domain contracts through method signatures and service interfaces. These serve as contracts between the UI layer, application logic, and backend services.

```dart
// Fetch the next profile card for a user’s deck
Future<ProfileCard?> getNextProfile(String userId);

// Record a swipe action, either Like or Pass
Future<Result<void>> processSwipe(String userId, String profileId, SwipeDirection direction);

// Determine if a mutual Like exists
Future<Match?> checkForMatch(String userId, String profileId);

// Create a persistent connection once a Match occurs
Future<Connection> createConnection(Match match);

// Exchange a message between two Matched users
Future<Result<Message>> sendMessage(String connectionId, String userId, String content);
```

Each function encodes a clear business rule. For example, `processSwipe` ensures that only valid swipe actions are stored, while `checkForMatch` guards the creation of Matches until both parties express interest.

===== User Interface Complement

A conceptual *Profile Card* widget in Flutter may look like this. This shows how domain concepts (like `ProfileCard`) translate directly into Flutter widgets.:

```dart
class ProfileCard extends StatelessWidget {
  final Profile profile;
  final VoidCallback onLike;
  final VoidCallback onPass;
  final VoidCallback onMoreInfo;

  const ProfileCard({
    required this.profile,
    required this.onLike,
    required this.onPass,
    required this.onMoreInfo,
    super.key,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
      margin: const EdgeInsets.all(12),
      child: Column(
        children: [
          Text(profile.name, style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline6),
          Text(profile.details),
          Row(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
            children: [
              IconButton(icon: Icon(Icons.close), onPressed: onPass),
              IconButton(icon: Icon(Icons.favorite), onPressed: onLike),
              IconButton(icon: Icon(Icons.info), onPressed: onMoreInfo),
            ],
          )
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

==== SOLID-Oriented Software Design

At the *software architecture* level, the system is divided into three main components:

. *Mobile Frontend (Flutter)* - Handles profile cards, swiping, and messaging.
. *Application Backend* - Contains the business logic for swiping, matching, and event handling.
. *Data Layer* - Manages persistence of profiles, swipes, Matches, and messages.

At the *software design* level, these components are realized through service classes and repositories. 
To ensure scalability and maintainability, the design applies the *SOLID principles*:

===== 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each service has one responsibility:  

* *Deck Service* → Builds personalized decks and presents the next profile card.  
* *Swipe Service* → Processes swipe gestures and evaluates potential Matches.  
* *Connection Service* → Manages new connections, messaging, and communication channels.  
* *Profile Service* → Retrieves detailed profile information.  
* *Session Service* → Handles authentication and user session management.  

===== 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Business rules can be extended without modifying existing code.  

* The deck generation algorithm can switch strategies (e.g., location-based, interest-based) without altering the service itself.  
* New swipe actions such as “Super Like” can be added without changing the base swipe logic.  

===== 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Services can be swapped with alternatives that share the same behavior.  

* Different matching strategies (e.g., mutual Likes, weighted scoring) can replace one another without breaking the system.  
* Notification services (push, email, SMS) can be substituted transparently.  

===== 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients depend only on the operations they use.  

* Messaging relies solely on a lightweight *Message Sender* interface, without being tied to connection logic.  
* Profile data access is split between read and write operations to avoid unnecessary coupling.  

===== 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules depend on abstractions, not low-level implementations.  

* Services depend on repositories and strategies rather than direct database queries.  
* Dependency injection makes it possible to swap data stores or notification channels at runtime.  



====== Example: Swiping and Matching Flow

```dart
class MatchingService {
  final SwipeRepository swipeRepository;
  final ConnectionService connectionService;

  MatchingService(this.swipeRepository, this.connectionService);

  Future<Result<void>> processSwipe(
      String userId, String profileId, SwipeDirection direction) async {
    await swipeRepository.save(userId, profileId, direction);

    if (direction == SwipeDirection.like) {
      final match = await checkForMatch(userId, profileId);
      if (match != null) {
        await connectionService.createConnection(match);
      }
    }
    return Result.success(null);
  }
}
```

This applies the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: the service only coordinates swiping logic and delegates persistence/connection creation to other components.



====== Example: Event RSVP Flow

```dart
Future<Result<Attendance>> rsvpEvent(String userId, String eventId) async {
  if (await eventRepository.hasCapacity(eventId)) {
    final attendance = Attendance(userId: userId, eventId: eventId, confirmed: true);
    await eventRepository.saveAttendance(attendance);
    return Result.success(attendance);
  }
  return Result.failure(CapacityReachedError());
}
```

This demonstrates the **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: RSVP logic can be extended (e.g., add waitlists) without changing its core behavior.









== Analytic Part

=== Concept Analysis

This section refines the raw material from the "Domain Rough Sketch" into a set of domain concepts, abstractions, and relationships, following the guidelines for concept analysis. The process began by reviewing unprocessed notes and quotes, then abstracting recurring ideas into general concepts, clarifying their meaning, and documenting how they relate. This analysis provides a foundation for requirements and system design.

==== Method
We systematically reviewed the rough sketch, highlighting recurring themes, terms, and pain points. For each, we considered whether it represented a domain concept, event, or behavior, and how it might generalize beyond the specific example. Where terms were ambiguous or used differently by stakeholders, we clarified or resolved them for consistency.

==== Key Concepts Identified

*Queue/Waiting Time*: Multiple students mentioned long waits at job fairs. We abstract this as the concept of a "queue," representing bottlenecks in event based interactions.

*Profile*: Résumés, portfolios, and company descriptions are generalized as "profiles", structured representations of actors in the domain. We distinguish between candidate and recruiter profiles.

*Match and Connection*: Mutual interest is abstracted as a "Match." If acted upon, this becomes a "connection", a persistent relationship enabling further interaction.

*Discovery Feed*: Reviewing multiple candidates or companies is generalized as a "discovery feed," the set of profiles available for evaluation.

*Event*: Job fairs, meetups, and interviews are all instances of "events," structuring interactions in time and space.

*Note Taking*: Recruiter's use of spreadsheets and notes is abstracted as "record keeping," essential for memory and making decisions in high volume interactions.

*Application*: Submitting interest through various channels is generalized as an "application," linking candidates to opportunities.

==== Clarifications and Resolutions

- The term "candidate" is used broadly to mean any job seeker, regardless of experience.
- "Recruiter" refers specifically to the human actor representing an employer, not the company itself.
- "Profile card" is distinguished from "profile" as the interactive, condensed representation used in the discovery process.
- "Match" is an event, while "connection" is a state that persists after a Match.

==== Relationships and Abstractions

- Candidates build and share their profiles, skills, and qualifications with recruiters.
- Recruiters evaluate candidates based on these profiles, often within the context of an event.
- When mutual interest is signaled, a Match is formed, which can become a connection.
- Connections enable further actions, such as messaging or scheduling interviews.
- Events provide the environment where many of these interactions are initiated.
- Record keeping and note taking support making decisions and memory throughout the process.

==== Reasoning and Process
This analysis was grounded in the raw observations and quotes from the rough sketch, ensuring that abstractions are traceable to real domain phenomena. Ambiguities were resolved by referencing both stakeholder language and the needs of the requirements phase. By documenting this process, we ensure that the resulting vocabulary is both consistent and shared across the team.

Through this analysis, the scattered ideas from the descriptive phase are distilled into a structured vocabulary. These concepts and relationships now form a shared foundation for the requirements and system design phases that follow.


=== Validation and Verification

The purpose of this section is to document how the team will validate and verify the domain concepts, requirements, and design decisions.

* **Validation**: ensuring that what we documented reflects the real-world domain (student–recruiter interactions, job fairs, portfolio showcases, and online hiring practices).  
* **Verification**: ensuring that the documentation is internally consistent, complete, and aligned with the project’s goals.

==== Validation Strategy
Validation activities focus on comparing our assumptions and requirements against real-world practices in recruiting and hiring.

* **Literature and Online References**  
  We reviewed external sources to validate that our domain concepts are realistic:  
  - National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) reports show that **over 80% of employers review student portfolios or online profiles during hiring**.  
  - LinkedIn’s Global Talent Trends indicate recruiters prioritize **skills, experiences, and project showcases** when evaluating candidates.  
  - University career center guidelines (e.g., UC Berkeley Career Center) recommend portfolios to include **projects, reflections, and artifacts**, supporting our profile/portfolio requirements.  

* **Scenario Walkthroughs (Planned)**  
  We drafted sample scenarios to test the plausibility of requirements:  
  - *Example*: “Student uploads a project to their portfolio. Recruiter filters by skill and reviews the project before deciding to Like or Pass.”  
  These walkthroughs will be refined with feedback once pilot users are available.

* **Stakeholder Proxies**  
  Since direct recruiter interviews have not yet been conducted, validation relies on **career center publications** and **industry surveys** as proxies for stakeholder expectations. Later stages will replace proxies with real recruiter and student feedback.


==== Verification Strategy
Verification ensures that the documentation is internally consistent and traceable across milestones.

* **Peer Reviews (Planned)**  
  Each section of the documentation (terminology, requirements, narrative) will be reviewed by a different team member. Early reviews already revealed ambiguities between the terms “candidate” and “student,” which were clarified.

* **Checklists**  
  A milestone-based checklist will be used:  
  - Every requirement uses only defined terms.  
  - Requirements map to at least one domain concept.  
  - No contradictions between terminology and requirements.  
  - Requirements are measurable and testable (planned for Milestone 2).  

* **Traceability Matrix (Planned)**  
  A lightweight traceability matrix will link:  
  - *Requirements → Goals* (does each requirement support at least one documented goal?).  
  - *Requirements → Terminology* (is consistent terminology used?).  

* **Walkthroughs of Documentation**  
  We will simulate “reader walkthroughs,” where one team member acts as an external reviewer and checks whether requirements can be traced back to definitions. This approach helps identify undefined or ambiguous terms.

===== #One-Page Interview Guide#
* Which events are immediate vs batch later? Give concrete examples.
* During quiet hours, what must still break through (by role/stage)?
* Preferred channel per event (push, in-app, email, SMS opt-in) and why.
* Timing windows: reminders (T-24h/T-2h), follow-ups after 48–72h silence, offer deadlines.
* Inbox filters you must have (Interview Today, Needs Feedback, New Priority Match, At-Risk/Idle X days).
* Triage: labels, urgency flags, snooze/mute rules.
* Exact deep-link target on open (thread top, interview card, offer card, note anchor).
* Receipts/“seen” policy (opt-in? per thread/org?). Etiquette concerns.
* Internal mentions: who gets notified and when (@roles, offer steps).
* Automatic follow-ups (first/second nudge cadence, templates).
* Compliance/consent: time zones, opt-in for SMS/email, do-not-disturb, retention.
* One thing current tools get wrong about notifications—and how to fix it.

===== #Synthesis#

*_What recruiters actually need from chat/notifications?_*

* Urgency rules separate true interrupts (reschedule<24h, offer, day-of interview) from batchable noise (status/sourcing).
* Per-thread quiet hours with role-based overrides for offer & day-of scheduling.
* Channels by event (push/in-app urgent; email digest for low-signal; SMS only with opt-in).
* Reliable deep links to the exact action (Interview card, Offer card, Note anchor).
* Inbox controls (Interview Today, Needs Feedback, New Priority Match, At-Risk/Idle).
* Polite automation (48/96h nudges; feedback prompt 2h; 72h re-invite).
* Etiquette & consent defaults (delivery receipts vs “seen”; stored per-channel consent).
* Outcomes: fewer no-shows, faster time-to-respond, clear audit of what alerted whom and why.

=== Isolating the Domain & Expressing Models in Software

==== #Modeling the Address as a Value Object#
:author: Carlos J. Pepín Delgado

[NOTE]
Objective: Apply Section 4.3 (Isolating the Domain & Expressing Models in Software) by refactoring the `StudentProfile` aggregate to include `Address` as an immutable Value Object. This isolates the domain model, enforces invariants at construction, and maintains persistence independence through a repository layer.

===== #Topic Overview#
Section 4.3 emphasizes modeling the domain in code by identifying **entities**, **value objects**, and **aggregates** that mirror real-world concepts. Entities are defined by identity, while value objects are defined solely by their attributes and must remain immutable. The lecture also introduced factories and repositories as tools to keep domain logic clean and separated from technical infrastructure.

===== #Application in the Project#
In the Professional Portfolio System, the `StudentProfile` aggregate initially scattered raw address fields (`street`, `city`, `postal_code`, etc.), which led to duplicated logic and weak cohesion. Through knowledge-crunching and discussion, this revealed an *implicit concept* — the Address itself. The team made it explicit as a dedicated `Address` Value Object embedded within the `StudentProfile` aggregate root.

The `StudentProfileRepository` mediates between the domain and Supabase, exposing methods in terms of domain concepts (`getById`, `updateAddress`) rather than SQL statements. This structure follows the Dependency Inversion Principle, allowing the domain to remain pure while infrastructure adapts around it.

===== #Implementation Summary#
* **Aggregate Definition:** `StudentProfile` acts as the aggregate root, controlling all access and updates to its internal `Address` object.  
* **Factory Construction:** `Address` uses a factory constructor that validates input and enforces domain rules before instance creation.  
* **Value Object Semantics:** Two `Address` instances with the same attribute values are equal; all fields are `final`, ensuring immutability.  
* **Repository Abstraction:** `StudentProfileRepository` translates between database rows and domain models (`_rowToAddress`, `_addressParams`) to maintain separation of concerns.  
* **Persistence Shape:** Six flat columns were added to `student_profiles` for address data:  
  `address_line1`, `address_line2`, `address_city`, `address_region`, `address_postal_code`, and `address_country_code`.  
  A constraint ensures the `country_code` is always a two-letter uppercase ISO-3166 value.  

===== #Invariants and Guards#
The following invariants must hold within the `Address` Value Object:
* `line1`, `city`, and `postalCode` cannot be empty.  
* `countryCode` must match `/^[A-Z]{2}$/`.  
* All string values are normalized (trimmed, single spaces).  
* Once created, an `Address` cannot be mutated; changes require a new instance.

Validation occurs at the boundary—user input is verified before `Address` construction to ensure all invariants hold.  
Profiles may temporarily lack an address (e.g., new user); null updates are intentionally supported to clear address data safely.

===== #Testing & Verification#
A live Supabase integration test demonstrated:
. The user authenticated and updated their own `StudentProfile` with a valid `Address`.  
. The repository persisted and retrieved the same value object correctly.  
. Null updates safely cleared all address columns.  
. Row-Level Security (RLS) correctly restricted updates to the profile owner.

All checks passed, confirming domain integrity, immutability, and persistence consistency.

===== #Outcome and Reflection#
Refactoring `Address` as a Value Object achieved:
* **Isolation of the Domain:** Address logic resides solely in the model; database details are hidden behind the repository.  
* **Cohesion and Clarity:** Related primitives unified under one explicit concept.  
* **Data Integrity:** Invariants enforce correctness at creation time.  
* **Expressive Model:** Code now mirrors the domain language (“profile has an address”) rather than database fields.  

This task fully embodies the lecture’s intent — expressing the domain through explicit modeling, factories, aggregates, and repositories — showing how theoretical design principles produce a practical, robust implementation.

===== #Traceability to Lecture Concepts#
[cols="2,4",options="header"]
|===
|Lecture Principle |Project Realization
|Aggregate |`StudentProfile` is the root controlling `Address` updates.
|Factory |`Address.factory()` enforces invariants before creation.
|Repository |`StudentProfileRepository` isolates domain from Supabase.
|Invariants |Validation of non-empty fields and ISO country code.
|Making Implicit Concepts Explicit |Recognized Address as a hidden concept, now modeled explicitly.

=== Life Cycle of Domain Objects

==== #StudentProfile Life Cycle#

The `StudentProfile` domain object represents a student within the system. Its lifecycle captures all possible states from creation to permanent deletion, including intermediate states such as active use and temporary archival. Understanding this lifecycle is critical to maintain data integrity, support aggregate consistency, and comply with domain rules.

===== #Lifecycle States#

* **Creation**: triggered when a student registers or the system instantiates a profile; initial validation and default values are assigned 
  - event: `StudentRegistered`
  - outcome: profile moves to **Active** after successful validation 

* **Active**: default operational state of the profile; student can update personal information, add experiences, adjust visibility; interacts with other aggregates (e.g., enrollments, submissions) 
  - events: `ProfileUpdated`, `ExperienceAdded`, `VisibilityChanged` 

* **Archived**: temporary deactivation due to inactivity, graduation, or administrative action  
  - profile becomes read-only
  - guard: only profiles meeting archival criteria can be archived 
  - event: `ProfileArchived` 
  - reactivation: `ProfileReactivated` moves profile back to **Active**

* **Deletion**: permanent removal from the system; ensures compliance and data integrity; may cascade to related aggregates (enrollments, submissions)  
  - guard: only authorized or archived profiles may be deleted  
  - event: `ProfileDeleted`  

===== #State Transitions#

Transitions are implied within the state descriptions and governed by events and guard conditions. Explicit state changes include:  

- Creation → Active: triggered by `StudentRegistered` and validation  
- Active → Archived: triggered by `ProfileArchived` when archival criteria are met
- Archived → Active: triggered by `ProfileReactivated`
- Active/Archived → Deletion: triggered by `ProfileDeleted` when authorized  

image::..\Images\StudentProfile.png[StudentProfile Lifecycle Diagram]

===== #Aggregate Deletion Rules#

The deletion of a `StudentProfile` must adhere to strict rules to maintain **aggregate consistency**, ensure **data integrity**, and comply with **domain policies**. The following rules apply:

* **Authorization Requirement**  
  - A profile can only be deleted if it is either archived or explicitly authorized for deletion by an administrator.  
  - Active profiles cannot be deleted without explicit authorization.

* **Cascading Deletions** 
  - Deleting a `StudentProfile` may require cascading deletion or modification of related aggregates:
    - **Enrollments:** Any active or historical enrollments linked to the student must be removed or anonymized.  
    - **Submissions/Assignments:** Student submissions may need to be archived, anonymized, or deleted according to retention policies.
    - **Notifications/Logs:** Events related to the profile should remain in the audit trail but must be decoupled from personally identifiable information. 

* **Validation Checks** 
  - Before deletion, the system must validate:  
    *** That no critical dependencies remain in other aggregates (e.g., group projects, team memberships).
    *** That deletion will not violate invariants of related domain objects.

* **Compliance and Audit**
  - All deletion events must be logged with timestamp, actor, and reason for deletion.
  - Logs must be immutable and stored according to institutional compliance requirements.
  - This ensures traceability and supports future audits or investigations.

* **Reversibility**  
  - Once deletion is executed, it is permanent.  
  - If recovery is required, it must rely on backups or archived snapshots, not the active database.  

* **Notification**  
  - Dependent aggregates or stakeholders (e.g., course instructors, admin systems) may receive notifications when a profile is deleted, ensuring all systems maintain consistent state. 

* **Guard Clauses**
  - Deletion is prevented if any of the above rules are violated. 
  - Only profiles satisfying all deletion conditions are allowed to transition into the `Deletion` state.
