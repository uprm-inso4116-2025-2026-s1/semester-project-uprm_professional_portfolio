[NOTE]
Objective: Understand what recruiters actually need from messaging and notifications to guide near-term design/implementation.

=== One-Page Interview Guide
* Which events are immediate vs batch later? Give concrete examples.
* During quiet hours, what must still break through (by role/stage)?
* Preferred channel per event (push, in-app, email, SMS opt-in) and why.
* Timing windows: reminders (T-24h/T-2h), follow-ups after 48–72h silence, offer deadlines.
* Inbox filters you must have (Interview Today, Needs Feedback, New Priority Match, At-Risk/Idle X days).
* Triage: labels, urgency flags, snooze/mute rules.
* Exact deep-link target on open (thread top, interview card, offer card, note anchor).
* Receipts/“seen” policy (opt-in? per thread/org?). Etiquette concerns.
* Internal mentions: who gets notified and when (@roles, offer steps).
* Automatic follow-ups (first/second nudge cadence, templates).
* Compliance/consent: time zones, opt-in for SMS/email, do-not-disturb, retention.
* One thing current tools get wrong about notifications—and how to fix it.

=== Interviews

*Interview 01:*
Mid-market Tech Recruiter · Date: 2025-10-05 · Mode: phone (28 min) · Region: urban + suburban sites · Anonymized

*Answer 1:* Immediate vs batch. _Immediate:_ same-day interviews, <24h reschedules, offer steps. _Batch:_ new applicants, minor status changes.

*Answer 2:* Quiet hours. 7pm–7am local; exceptions: <24h reschedule, offer accept/expire.

*Answer 3:* Channels. Urgent → push + in-app (SMS if candidate opted-in); routine → in-app + email digest.

*Answer 4:* Timing. Reminders T-24h/T-2h; feedback prompt 2h post-interview; no-reply nudges at 48h/96h.

*Answer 5:* Filters. Interview Today, Needs Feedback, New Priority Match, Idle 3+ days.

*Answer 6:* Triage. Urgent flag; snooze until 08:00; mute threads after closure.

*Answer 7:* links. Open the interview card pinned inside the thread.

*Answer 8:* Receipts. Delivery timestamp OK; “seen” off by default (adds pressure).

*Answer 9:* Internal. Hiring Manager on interview feedback; Finance only on offer.

*Answer 10:* Automation. “Thanks—feedback soon” to candidates; 48/96h nudges to keep momentum.

*Answer 11:* Compliance. Respect candidate time zone; store per-channel consent; honor DND.

*Answer 12:* tools. Too many pings; batch low-signal changes and keep deep links precise.

|Theme |Signals / Details
|Urgent |Interview day, reschedule<24h, offer
|Batch |New applicant, non-critical status change
|Policies |Per-thread quiet hours + role overrides
|Navigation |Deep link → interview/offer card
|Etiquette |Delivery receipts over “seen”
|Automation |48/96h nudges; 2h feedback prompt
|===

*Interview 2:*
Agency Recruiter (multi-timezone) · Date: 2025-10-06 · Mode: video (28 min) · Region: urban + suburban sites · Anonymized

*Answer 1:* Immediate vs batch. Immediate: offer steps, day-of schedule changes. Batch: sourcing/status updates.

*Answer 2:* Quiet hours. After 7pm local; override only for <24h reschedules/offer deadlines.

*Answer 3:* Channels. Urgent → push; day-of SMS if opted-in; daily email digest for summaries.

*Answer 4:* Timing. T-24h/T-2h reminders; auto re-invite at 72h no-reply.

*Answer 5:* Filters. Interview Today, Offer Pending, At-Risk (no response 96h).

*Answer 6:* Triage. Labels: Urgent / Follow-up / Waiting; snooze per thread.

*Answer 7:* Deep links. Interview details with join link and call button.

*Answer 8:* Receipts. Opt-in per thread; org default is off.

*Answer 9:* Internal. @Legal/@Finance only during offer; no alerts for routine notes.

*Answer 10:* Automation. Post-interview “thank you” + 48/96h nudges.

*Answer 11:* Compliance. Regional DND and recorded consent (SMS/email).

*Answer 12:* Gap in tools. Alerts are not role-aware; everything notifies everyone.

|Theme |Signals / Details
|Urgent |Reschedule<24h, offer, interview reminder
|Batch |Sourcing and stage changes

=== Synthesis

*_What recruiters actually need from chat/notifications?_*

* Urgency rules separate true interrupts (reschedule<24h, offer, day-of interview) from batchable noise (status/sourcing).
* Per-thread quiet hours with role-based overrides for offer & day-of scheduling.
* Channels by event (push/in-app urgent; email digest for low-signal; SMS only with opt-in).
* Reliable deep links to the exact action (Interview card, Offer card, Note anchor).
* Inbox controls (Interview Today, Needs Feedback, New Priority Match, At-Risk/Idle).
* Polite automation (48/96h nudges; feedback prompt 2h; 72h re-invite).
* Etiquette & consent defaults (delivery receipts vs “seen”; stored per-channel consent).
* Outcomes: fewer no-shows, faster time-to-respond, clear audit of what alerted whom and why.

|===

[NOTE]
SMS is sent only where candidate consent is stored. Each SMS event must respect local regulations and recorded opt-in preferences.

=== Prioritization
==== Must
* Policy engine for urgency & quiet hours (thread/role aware)
* Reliable deep links (interview/offer/note anchors)
* RSVP + calendar integration
* Morning digest (07:30 local) for low-signal updates
* Auto-nudge at 48/96h silence
* Internal @mentions with anchors

==== Should
* Opt-in delivery receipts and SLA badges
* Candidate quiet hours and consent per channel
* Role-based overrides for urgent events

==== Could
* Stage-aware bundling of notifications
* Intent/sentiment hints in threads

==== Won’t (now)
* Cross-org notification analytics

=== Implementable Requirements

==== R1 — Policy Engine for Urgency & Quiet Hours
[source,gherkin]
----
Feature: Notification policy engine

Scenario: Reschedule within 24 hours breaks quiet hours
  Given the thread has quiet hours from 19:00 to 07:00
  And an interview is rescheduled 12 hours before start
  When the event is processed at 22:00
  Then a HIGH priority push notification is sent
  And the deep link opens the interview card

Scenario: Non-urgent updates during quiet hours are batched
  Given quiet hours are active
  When a status change event occurs
  Then no push is sent
  And the update appears in the 07:30 digest
----

==== R2 — Interview RSVP + Calendar Deep Link
[source,gherkin]
----
Feature: RSVP and calendar

Scenario: Candidate receives invite
  Given an interview invite is sent
  When the candidate opens the notification
  Then the app shows RSVP buttons
  And an .ics file is available
  And the meeting link is visible
----

==== R3 — Daily Digest at 07:30 Local
[source,gherkin]
----
Feature: Morning digest

Scenario: Recruiter starts day
  Given there are interviews today and 48h+ unreplied threads
  When it is 07:30 local time
  Then a digest groups interviews, unreplied threads, and new priority matches
  And each item deep links to the exact context
----

==== R4 — Auto-Nudge After Silence (48h/96h)
[source,gherkin]
----
Feature: Auto follow-up

Scenario: First nudge at 48h
  Given a candidate has not replied for 48 hours
  When automation runs
  Then a polite nudge is posted in the thread

Scenario: At-risk at 96h
  Given no reply after the first nudge
  When 96 hours elapse
  Then a second nudge is posted
  And the thread is labeled "At Risk"
----

==== R5 — Thread-Level Mute/Snooze
[source,gherkin]
----
Feature: Snooze thread

Scenario: Snooze until tomorrow 08:00
  Given a recruiter snoozes a thread until 08:00 tomorrow
  Then no notifications are sent for that thread until 08:00
  And a "Snoozed" badge is visible
----

==== R6 — Internal @Mentions with Anchors
[source,gherkin]
----
Feature: Internal mentions

Scenario: Mention hiring manager
  Given a note mentions the hiring manager
  Then the manager receives a notification
  And opening it jumps to the note anchor in the thread
----

==== R7 — Delivery Receipts + SLA Badges (opt-in)
[source,gherkin]
----
Feature: Delivery receipts and SLA

Scenario: SLA risk after threshold
  Given the organization SLA is response within 24 hours
  And a message has been delivered for 24 hours without reply
  Then the thread shows "SLA at risk"
----

=== Traceability — Pain → Event → Requirement
[cols="3,3,1",options="header"]
|===
|Pain Point |Event(s) |Requirement(s)
|Too many alerts / noise overload |Reschedule<24h, Interview reminders, Offer updates |R1 (Policy Engine), R3 (Morning Digest)
|Missed follow-ups / dropped threads |No Reply 48h/96h |R4 (Auto-Nudge After Silence)
|Wrong screen after tapping notification |All (Interview, Offer, Mention) |R2 (Deep Links + RSVP/Calendar)
|Coordination gaps between roles |Internal @Mention |R6 (Internal @Mentions with Anchors)
|Pressure from read receipts |Any (messages, updates) |R7 (Delivery Receipts opt-in)
|Need for silent focus time |All (Batch, low-priority) |R1 (Policy Engine + Quiet Hours)
|Inconsistent candidate updates |Interview reminder, Offer deadline |R2 (RSVP/Calendar), R3 (Digest)
|===

[NOTE]
Each pain maps to a specific event type in the notification matrix and to at least one implementable requirement (R1–R7).
