==== Current Situation

  The transition from academia to the professional workforce presents a significant challenge for both recent graduates and employers. For students, the job search often feels impersonal and inefficient, characterized by sending countless applications into automated systems with low response rates—a phenomenon often referred to as the "resume black hole." A study by Forbes Advisor noted that nearly 60% of job seekers report feeling ghosted by a prospective employer, leading to frustration and career anxiety. Conversely, employers face their own difficulties in this saturated market; they are inundated with applications for entry-level positions, many from candidates who are not a strong skills or culture fit, making it time-consuming and costly to identify truly suitable talent. This inefficient, transactional process fails to capture the potential for genuine, mutual interest between a candidate's aspirations and a company's mission, creating a disconnected and often discouraging experience for both parties involved.

==== Domain Rough Sketch

NOTE: This is an unprocessed collection of notes, quotes, and observations from the domain (student–recruiter interactions). 

- Student: "At the job fair, I stood in line 40 minutes just to hand over my résumé."
- Recruiter: "We meet hundreds of students in a single afternoon. After a while, names and faces blur together."
- Some recruiters use spreadsheets during the fair to jot notes about students: "Has Python," "Strong communication," "Not ready."
- Student frustration: "I never know if recruiters actually looked at my résumé or if it went into a pile."
- Recruiter: "We usually contact students weeks later, but many either lose interest or already have offers by then."
- Students often rely on school provided career services for résumé templates, but recruiters say they "all look the same."
- Recruiters: "We prefer quick ways to identify students with the right skills rather than going résumé by résumé."
- Informal hallway conversations sometimes lead to opportunities, students value those more than formal booths.
- Some recruiters only target juniors and seniors, ignoring freshmen.
- Student: "I’m nervous approaching a recruiter if I don’t already know about the company."
- Recruiters say a lot of students come unprepared, don’t know what positions are open.
- Student: "I applied through Handshake, LinkedIn, and the company website. Did they even see my application?"
- Recruiter: "We’re under pressure to find talent quickly. If the first batch of candidates looks good, we stop looking."
- Some recruiters mention re-hiring interns they already know -> "trust factor."
- Students compare the process to "speed dating", due to quick, superficial interactions.
- Recruiters complain they can’t gauge "soft skills" (teamwork, communication) in the short job fair chats.
- Student: "I wish I knew immediately if I had a chance instead of waiting months."
- Job fairs are often loud, crowded, chaotic -> recruiters and students both stressed.
- Some recruiters hand out swag -> students often remember the company by this.
- Students sometimes attend fairs "just to practice talking" rather than actually seeking jobs.
- Recruiters: "We’d like to pre screen students before the fair to save time."
