=== Current Situation, Needs, Ideas

==== Current Situation

The transition from academia to the professional workforce presents a significant challenge for both recent graduates and employers. For students, the job search often feels impersonal and inefficient, characterized by sending countless applications into automated systems with low response rates—a phenomenon often referred to as the "resume black hole." A study by Forbes Advisor noted that nearly 60% of job seekers report feeling ghosted by a prospective employer, leading to frustration and career anxiety. Conversely, employers face their own difficulties in this saturated market; they are inundated with applications for entry-level positions, many from candidates who are not a strong skills or culture fit, making it time-consuming and costly to identify truly suitable talent. This inefficient, transactional process fails to capture the potential for genuine, mutual interest between a candidate's aspirations and a company's mission, creating a disconnected and often discouraging experience for both parties involved.

==== Need

Structural friction in early-career recruiting (lack of visibility, opaque communication, and operational overload) 
reveals needs that belong to domain actors, not to a platform. The needs are outlined below.

===== Applicant / Recent Graduates
* Be discoverable for roles that truly match skills, interests, eligibility, availability, and location.  
* Receive timely, transparent feedback about interest and status to reduce ghosting and uncertainty.  
* Ensure fair access to opportunities and maintain control over privacy when sharing work and personal data.  
* Obtain guidance to translate coursework, projects, and soft skills into recruiter-trusted signals.  

===== Employers / Recruiters
* Efficient triage toward candidates who meet must-have criteria and show mutual interest.  
* Rich, trustworthy evidence of capability and professional culture.  
* Predictable, compliant communication and scheduling to minimize drop-off and miscommunication.  

===== Cross-Cutting Needs
* Mutual-interest signaling before deep engagement.  
* Early expectation alignment on role scope, compensation range, work modality, and timeline.  
* Low-friction coordination for first conversations and follow-ups.  
* Trust and safety: identity assurance, respectful conduct, and clear reporting channels.  

===== Project-Internal Enabling Needs
* A shared domain description and a baseline set of requirements so the team understands needs independently of any system-to-be.  
* A consistent, ubiquitous language across analysis, design, and code to prevent concept drift.  
* Plans for requirements, architecture, component design, implementation, and testing to support whatever idea is chosen later.  


==== Ideas

We propose a three-part design focused on a personalized, efficient, and high-quality user experience. The foundation of this approach is a onboarding and profile system. The system would create two fundamentally different experiences based on the user, whether they are a recruiter or a candidate. The system will request only the most relevant information for each persona, such as portfolios for students or verifying company details for recruiters. The system will have an interface that avoids clutter and ensures the platform feels built for each user from their very first interaction. Making it easier and more inclusive without replacing the current infrastructure.

Once users are onboarded, the swiping mechanism would enhance the core matching process by moving beyond a simple binary decision. This means creating carefully designed cards that act as a information display. The profiles can have an simple view and a more detailed view. The key to this design is a hierarchy that is informed by user research and which surfaces key decision making data relevant to the user directly in the swiping interface to maximize informed matches without causing overload.

Finally, to ensure connections are meaningful and productive, the mutual match connection and messaging gateway would unlock only after both parties have shown interest. Afterwards, the system would immediately facilitate the first message and it could include some kind of icebreaker or customizable openers. Furthermore, a dedicated inbox to keep users organized, allow for easy profile review, and potentially integrate scheduling tools, transforming a simple match into a genuine gateway to opportunity.


=== Scope, Span, and Synopsis

==== Scope and Span

===== Scope
The project's scope is to develop a mobile application aimed at improving the connection between students and recruiters. The app will address issues with traditional job search platforms and career fairs, which are often impersonal and inefficient, leading to a lack of engagement and missed opportunities. The project will encompass several key areas:

* Domain Engineering: Analyze the current landscape of student-recruiter engagement, identifying pain points in job fairs, static job boards, and passive search platforms. The goal is to create a faster, more efficient, and more engaging way for students and recruiters to connect.

* Requirements Engineering: Define system requirements to enable students to showcase their skills, qualifications, portfolios, and preferences dynamically. Recruiters will also be able to display what their company is offering and looking for. Requirements will focus on improving job placement rates, event attendance, and reducing the time spent in the recruitment process. These requirements will be refined continuously using direct feedback from both students and recruiters.

* Software Architecture: The architecture will feature a mobile front-end with a Tinder-like swiping system, real-time notifications, and event integration. The back-end will connect with job boards, applicant tracking systems, career services, and on-campus event data to strengthen student-recruiter engagement.

* Software Design Process: The project will follow an iterative design and development process, beginning with a pilot test to evaluate performance and identify areas of improvement. User feedback will drive optimization of the user interface, swiping experience, and the matching algorithm.

===== Span
The project's span is focused on creating a scalable and user-friendly solution that streamlines the student-recruiter connection process. The app is designed to support efficient matching, real-time communication, and event integration.

* Specifics of the System: Students can create detailed profiles including videos, portfolios, and soft skills. Recruiters will also create company profiles that highlight roles, culture, and expectations. When both parties swipe right, they are notified of a match and can begin communicating via chat or set up interviews. The app will also notify students about campus events that involve companies they have swiped right on, even if a match has not occurred.

* Target Audience and Expansion: The initial span of the project involves a pilot test with a defined user base of students and recruiters. Expansion will include partnerships with recruiters, direct marketing to universities, and support for on-campus career fairs. Over time, the platform will expand to larger student and recruiter networks beyond the initial pilot.

* Methodology and Maintenance: The project will adopt an iterative methodology with regular update cycles guided by new technology trends and continuous user feedback. Effectiveness will be tracked through key metrics such as app usage frequency, match success rate, recruiter follow-up rate, event attendance, and user satisfaction. The cycle of feedback, optimization and scaling will ensure the app remains relevant and impactful.

==== Synopsis

=== Derived Goals

== Descriptive Part

=== Domain Description

==== Domain Rough Sketch

NOTE: This is an unprocessed collection of notes, quotes, and observations from the domain (student-recruiter interactions). 

- Student: "At the job fair, I stood in line 40 minutes just to hand over my résumé."
- Recruiter: "We meet hundreds of students in a single afternoon. After a while, names and faces blur together."
- Some recruiters use spreadsheets during the fair to jot notes about students: "Has Python," "Strong communication," "Not ready."
- Student frustration: "I never know if recruiters actually looked at my résumé or if it went into a pile."
- Recruiter: "We usually contact students weeks later, but many either lose interest or already have offers by then."
- Students often rely on school provided career services for résumé templates, but recruiters say they "all look the same."
- Recruiters: "We prefer quick ways to identify students with the right skills rather than going résumé by résumé."
- Informal hallway conversations sometimes lead to opportunities, students value those more than formal booths.
- Some recruiters only target juniors and seniors, ignoring freshmen.
- Student: "I’m nervous approaching a recruiter if I don’t already know about the company."
- Recruiters say a lot of students come unprepared, don’t know what positions are open.
- Student: "I applied through Handshake, LinkedIn, and the company website. Did they even see my application?"
- Recruiter: "We’re under pressure to find talent quickly. If the first batch of candidates looks good, we stop looking."
- Some recruiters mention re-hiring interns they already know -> "trust factor."
- Students compare the process to "speed dating", due to quick, superficial interactions.
- Recruiters complain they can’t gauge "soft skills" (teamwork, communication) in the short job fair chats.
- Student: "I wish I knew immediately if I had a chance instead of waiting months."
- Job fairs are often loud, crowded, chaotic -> recruiters and students both stressed.
- Some recruiters hand out swag -> students often remember the company by this.
- Students sometimes attend fairs "just to practice talking" rather than actually seeking jobs.
- Recruiters: "We’d like to pre screen students before the fair to save time."

==== Terminology

==== Domain Terminology in Relation to Domain Rough Sketch

* Recruiter: (Actor)A user who represents a company or organization and uses the platform to discover and evaluate potential candidates. This term was refined from the rough concept of employer to specify the human actor, distinct from the company entity itself.
* Candidate: (Actor)A user who is seeking professional opportunities and uses the platform to discover companies and recruiters by reviewing recruiter profiles. This term should be revised as a candidate alludes to the user's primary role once a connection is made.
* Profile: The core digital representation of a user within the system. It is categorized as either a candidate profile or a recruiter profile containing corresponding relevant information.
* Swipe: The primary gesture of evaluation. A right swipe indicates a like or expression of interest, and a left swipe indicates a Pass, which indicates a dismissal. This defines the core action of the system, removing ambiguity from the informal "Tinder-like" description.
* Profile Card: The user interface component that presents a condensed view of a Profile within the feed for the purpose of being swiped on. This term distinguishes the interactive element from the full Profile data structure.
* Match: A domain event that occurs only when two users have mutually Liked each other's profile cards.
* Connection: The persistent relationship state between two users that is established upon a match. This term defines the context in which messaging and further interaction can occur. Moving beyond the transient event of the match itself.
* Discovery Feed: The main application view where a user is presented with a “deck” of profile cards to evaluate. This term provides a specific name for the core screen, derived from its purpose.


==== Narrative

The domain concerns how employers identify, evaluate, and hire talent, and how job seekers explore and compare opportunities. In this context, the term “candidate” is used broadly to mean any person seeking a job, regardless of prior experience or stage of career. The observable world of the domain includes candidates with educational and employment histories, competencies, and preferences; employers with staffing needs and hiring calendars; recruiters who operate search and prioritization criteria; openings defined by requirements, number of positions, and relevant dates; application documents such as résumés, certifications, portfolios, and references; and recruitment events with agendas and limited capacity. Information circulates through common channels such as postings, professional networks, referrals, unions, and agencies, under rules of eligibility and time availability.

A typical cycle begins when an employer defines and disseminates a vacancy with explicit requirements, for example minimum experience, qualifications, licenses or certifications, languages, and legal authorizations, together with job conditions such as work modality, location, reference compensation, and start date. Candidates discover these opportunities, compare requirements to their profile, and express interest. Reciprocally, recruiters may pursue profiles based on observable signals such as track record, achievements, work samples, or references. Eligibility verification precedes any advance. Based on that verification and perceived fit, shortlists are formed and, when appropriate, additional screenings are conducted, including technical or psychometric tests. Interviews are scheduled in non-overlapping time slots, held in person or virtually, and conclude with observations that inform later decisions.

When there is sufficient correspondence between needs and demonstrated capabilities, the employer issues an offer with explicit terms and a validity period. Clarifications or adjustments may follow, after which the candidate accepts or declines within the stated deadline. In parallel, recruitment events concentrate interactions: an audience is convened, capacity is managed, attendance is confirmed, and participation is recorded. From these contacts, new expressions of interest and applications can emerge without a prior formal submission. Relevant information, including requirements, application states, evaluations, schedules, and event capacity, shows varying degrees of structure, which explains asymmetries and information overload on both sides.

The domain is governed by stable rules: each search process ties recruiters to a specific employer; candidates and openings relate in a many-to-many manner through applications; applications do not advance without meeting minimum requirements; no person is assigned to overlapping interviews; attendance at an event consumes available capacity; and offers expire if no response is received within their validity period. Cyclical patterns also exist, with posting and closing windows that shape supply, participation, and acceptance decisions. This description reflects how the labor market operates, independent of any system to be built.

|===

===== Actions

*Candidate.*  
Before showing up, the candidate tunes the résumé and, if applicable, the professional portfolio to the role and researches the company. When it is their turn, they deliver a brief elevator pitch, hand over a résumé, and ask specific questions. In parallel, they submit applications through one or more platforms and keep a courteous follow up thread by email or LinkedIn. If responses stall or plans change, they may withdraw or pause the application.

*Recruiter.*  
The recruiter defines the role, its requirements, and the target audience, whether junior or senior, students or experienced hires. They publish the opening and organize their presence at fairs or meetups. During screening, they jot quick notes and tags about candidates, run prescreens, invite candidates to interviews, and keep communication moving. When the first batch covers the need, sourcing stops. Known talent such as former interns is often prioritized because the risk is lower.

*System/Institution.*  
Supports communication and record keeping. It announces events and openings, records check-ins, centralizes résumés and applications, deduplicates multichannel entries, and preserves traceability through versioning and logs. It also provides tools for note taking and auditable prescreen rules.

*Third parties.*  
Referees and background check providers supply information that helps corroborate the hiring decision when appropriate.

===== Behaviors

*In person recruiting flow.*  
The process moves from announcement to attendance, then queuing, a brief conversation at the booth, and follow up. Noise, crowding, and time pressure push interactions toward quick impressions and coarse screening. Soft skills are hard to judge in under a minute.

*Multichannel applications and unclear status.*  
Candidates often apply through several portals and by referral. Without a single source of truth, duplicate records and uncertain statuses appear, which confuses both sides and slows review.

*Fast screening and prioritization.*  
To manage volume, recruiters rely on simple heuristics such as year, visible skills, and seniority, as well as rule based filters. Throughput improves, but the risk of overlooking strong profiles increases.

*Communication delay and attrition.*  
If outreach arrives weeks after the first contact, interest declines and other processes advance. Early signals and timely touchpoints reduce drop off.

*Stopping after the first promising group.*  
When the initial cohort seems sufficient, active sourcing pauses. The window for new applicants narrows and the range of options can shrink.

*Rehiring based on trust.*  
People already known to the team, such as former interns, are often prioritized because their performance is validated. Time to hire shortens and uncertainty decreases compared with external candidates.

*Uneven candidate preparation.*  
Some arrive with generic résumés or limited knowledge of the company, while others attend mainly to practice and build confidence. The level of preparation shapes the quality of the pitch and the impression left.

*Informal networking that converts well.*  
Unplanned conversations away from the booth allow calmer and more genuine exchanges that sometimes outperform the formal interaction.

*Notes as the memory of the process.*  
With many brief encounters, concise notes and tags become essential to remember people and make decisions. Consistent record keeping improves later review and shortlist quality.

*Brand recall from presence and giveaways.*  
A well run booth and thoughtful materials strengthen memory of the employer and help reengage candidates after the event.

==== Function Signatures

The system's core domain logic is defined by a set of function signatures that explicitly outline operations, inputs, outputs, and potential failure states. The core user interaction is governed by swiping and matching mechanics. The process is as follows; getNextProfile : UserId -> Option ProfileCard, this function fetches the next profile card from a user's personalized deck and returns none if the deck is empty. Once a user swipes,processSwipe : UserId >< ProfileId >< SwipeDirection -> Result<Unit, Error> records the swipe direction to determine like or pass for a given profile, returning a result that signifies success or an error. Following a like action, checkForMatch : UserId >< ProfileId -> Option Match determines if the swipe created a mutual like.

Upon a successful match, profile and connection management functions take over. The createConnection : Match -> Connection function creates persistent  new connections between the two users, establishing a channel for communication. Immediately after a connection is formed, sendMessage : ConnectionId >< UserId >< MessageContent -> Result<Message, Error> allows a participant to add a new message to the chat history, returning the sent message or an error for invalid requests. For viewing detailed information, getProfile : UserId -> Result<Profile, Error> retrieves a user's full profile as opposed to the condensed profile card with checks to ensure the requester has appropriate permissions.

Finally, session and state management functions handle user authentication and data preparation. The initializeUserSession : UserCredentials -> Result<UserSession, Error> function authenticates a user's credentials and, if successful, creates a user session containing their identity and role. To populate the swiping interface, getUserDeck : UserId -> Deck is responsible for building a user's deck of profile cards. This function encapsulates the platform's matching algorithm, dynamically generating a personalized queue of profiles based on the user's preferences and past activity.

==== Domain Requirements

The system must uniquely identify every candidate, every recruiter, every employer, and every event organizer, while distinguishing natural persons from institutional profiles when the entity is a company or an organizer, and it must record the role performed by each entity in every interaction together with the time and the context of that role. The system must represent every opening with explicit requirements including minimum experience, qualifications, certifications, languages, legal authorizations, work modality, location, compensation range, and start date, must record the number of positions available for each opening, must link every opening to its responsible employer, and must allow requirement updates while preserving a complete history of changes. The system must represent each candidate profile with education, work history, competencies, certifications, portfolios, and verifiable references, must allow attaching documents to the profile preserving issue date, validity, and verification status, and must record candidate preferences such as areas of interest, desired location, and work modality. The system must represent recruiting events with name, organizer, venue, agenda, date, and capacity, must represent company booths or tables within each event and their relation to the promoted openings, must register attendance and arrival of candidates and recruiters, and must enforce registration rules and capacity limits defined by the organizer. The system must model queues in front of booths or tables preserving a first come first served order, must allow limiting the duration of each turn, must register the closure of each turn by staff, and must prevent assigning turns that exceed the declared capacity of a booth or of a time block. The system must allow candidates and recruiters to express interest in openings or in profiles and must record when the expression is reciprocal, must create a match when both sides express positive interest and must preserve the date and the context of that event, must allow recruiters to define shortlisting criteria based on requirements and evidence and must register the decision with its justification, and must allow candidates to withdraw their interest and update any pending matches. The system must represent availability of candidates and recruiters through calendars and time blocks, must schedule interviews only on valid matches, must prevent double booking of the same block, and must register interview outcomes with clear states such as continues in process, rejected, or offer extended together with the date and the responsible party. The system must allow message exchanges between candidate and recruiter only when there is a valid match or an explicit permission from the candidate, must register candidate consent for sharing information with an employer or with an organizer, and must allow revocation of that consent. The system must compute and display the degree of requirement fulfillment for each candidate with categories such as meets, partially meets, or does not meet, must prevent practices that alter queue order without a rule defined by the event such as priority for confirmed appointments, and must keep an auditable record of shortlisting and rejection decisions together with their criteria. The system must notify candidates and recruiters when a match is created, when an interview is confirmed, and when changes to opening requirements affect eligibility, and it must notify candidates about recruiting events related to employers or openings in which they have shown interest. The system must record domain metrics such as match rate, queue waiting time, average turn duration, follow up rate after matches, and event attendance, and it must support funnel analysis from expression of interest to offer extended in order to identify bottlenecks. The system must prevent the creation of matches when any party does not exist or when the opening is closed, must keep the link between every document and the identity of the person or the entity that provided it together with its validation status, and must preserve the full state history of each opening and of each candidacy from origin to closure.

==== Interface Requirements

The first requirement is that the system must provide a means for a new user identifying as a recruiter to initialize their internal recruiter profile representation. This initialization shall be performed by the recruiter via a structured form presented during the registration process. The form must include fields to capture the shared phenomena of company name, professional email address, and job role. The initialisation process shall include a validation step where a confirmation email is sent to the provided professional email address. The internal profile representation shall not be considered active until this validation is complete.

Secondly, the system must provide a means to update the internal representation of a student's skills when these phenomena change in the domain such as adding new projects. The student shall be able to initiate an update via an edit profile screen. The system shall provide input fields and controls to allow the student to modify their skill set. The internal representation shall be updated immediately upon the student saving the changes.
The next requirement is that the internal event of a match must be communicated to the involved users to reflect this new shared state in the domain. The system shall present a visual notification to both users immediately upon the match being recorded in the system. This interface must provide a clear indication of who the match is with and shall include a prominent means to initiate communication, thereby enabling the next domain action.

The system must provide a means for an authorized recruiter to correct the internal representation of their company's information if it was initially entered incorrectly or becomes outdated. Recruiters shall have access to a company profile management screen. This interface shall allow them to edit fields such as company description and website URL. The system shall log all such changes. The company name field shall be immutable through this interface after the initial validation to ensure traceability. Changes to the company name must be handled by a separate administrative process to maintain data integrity.

Lastly, the internal system state must be updated to reflect a user's swipe action on a profile card. The user's gesture shall be the sole initiating action. The system shall immediately update the internal state to record this decision and remove the presented profile card from the user's current deck. No explicit save or confirm action is required; the gesture itself is the interface event.
