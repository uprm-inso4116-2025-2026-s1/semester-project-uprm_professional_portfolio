=== Current Situation, Needs, Ideas

==== Current Situation

The transition from academia to the professional workforce presents a significant challenge for both recent graduates and employers. For students, the job search often feels impersonal and inefficient, characterized by sending countless applications into automated systems with low response rates—a phenomenon often referred to as the "resume black hole." A study by Forbes Advisor noted that nearly 60% of job seekers report feeling ghosted by a prospective employer, leading to frustration and career anxiety. Conversely, employers face their own difficulties in this saturated market; they are inundated with applications for entry-level positions, many from candidates who are not a strong skills or culture fit, making it time-consuming and costly to identify truly suitable talent. This inefficient, transactional process fails to capture the potential for genuine, mutual interest between a candidate's aspirations and a company's mission, creating a disconnected and often discouraging experience for both parties involved. 

==== Need

Structural friction in early-career recruiting (lack of visibility, opaque communication, and operational overload) 
reveals needs that belong to domain actors, not to a platform. The needs are outlined below.

===== Applicant / Recent Graduates
* Be discoverable for roles that truly match skills, interests, eligibility, availability, and location.  
* Receive timely, transparent feedback about interest and status to reduce ghosting and uncertainty.  
* Ensure fair access to opportunities and maintain control over privacy when sharing work and personal data.  
* Obtain guidance to translate coursework, projects, and soft skills into recruiter-trusted signals.  

===== Employers / Recruiters
* Efficient triage toward candidates who meet must-have criteria and show mutual interest.  
* Rich, trustworthy evidence of capability and professional culture.  
* Predictable, compliant communication and scheduling to minimize drop-off and miscommunication.  

===== Cross-Cutting Needs
* Mutual-interest signaling before deep engagement.  
* Early expectation alignment on role scope, compensation range, work modality, and timeline.  
* Low-friction coordination for first conversations and follow-ups.  
* Trust and safety: identity assurance, respectful conduct, and clear reporting channels.  

===== Project-Internal Enabling Needs
* A shared domain description and a baseline set of requirements so the team understands needs independently of any system-to-be.  
* A consistent, ubiquitous language across analysis, design, and code to prevent concept drift.  
* Plans for requirements, architecture, component design, implementation, and testing to support whatever idea is chosen later.  


==== Ideas

=== Scope, Span, and Synopsis

==== Scope and Span

===== Scope
The project's scope is to develop a mobile application aimed at improving the connection between students and recruiters. The app will address issues with traditional job search platforms and career fairs, which are often impersonal and inefficient, leading to a lack of engagement and missed opportunities. The project will encompass several key areas:

* Domain Engineering: Analyze the current landscape of student-recruiter engagement, identifying pain points in job fairs, static job boards, and passive search platforms. The goal is to create a faster, more efficient, and more engaging way for students and recruiters to connect.

* Requirements Engineering: Define system requirements to enable students to showcase their skills, qualifications, portfolios, and preferences dynamically. Recruiters will also be able to display what their company is offering and looking for. Requirements will focus on improving job placement rates, event attendance, and reducing the time spent in the recruitment process. These requirements will be refined continuously using direct feedback from both students and recruiters.

* Software Architecture: The architecture will feature a mobile front-end with a Tinder-like swiping system, real-time notifications, and event integration. The back-end will connect with job boards, applicant tracking systems, career services, and on-campus event data to strengthen student-recruiter engagement.

* Software Design Process: The project will follow an iterative design and development process, beginning with a pilot test to evaluate performance and identify areas of improvement. User feedback will drive optimization of the user interface, swiping experience, and the matching algorithm.

===== Span
The project's span is focused on creating a scalable and user-friendly solution that streamlines the student-recruiter connection process. The app is designed to support efficient matching, real-time communication, and event integration.

* Specifics of the System: Students can create detailed profiles including videos, portfolios, and soft skills. Recruiters will also create company profiles that highlight roles, culture, and expectations. When both parties swipe right, they are notified of a match and can begin communicating via chat or set up interviews. The app will also notify students about campus events that involve companies they have swiped right on, even if a match has not occurred.

* Target Audience and Expansion: The initial span of the project involves a pilot test with a defined user base of students and recruiters. Expansion will include partnerships with recruiters, direct marketing to universities, and support for on-campus career fairs. Over time, the platform will expand to larger student and recruiter networks beyond the initial pilot.

* Methodology and Maintenance: The project will adopt an iterative methodology with regular update cycles guided by new technology trends and continuous user feedback. Effectiveness will be tracked through key metrics such as app usage frequency, match success rate, recruiter follow-up rate, event attendance, and user satisfaction. The cycle of feedback, optimization and scaling will ensure the app remains relevant and impactful.

== Descriptive Part

=== Domain Description

==== Domain Rough Sketch

NOTE: This is an unprocessed collection of notes, quotes, and observations from the domain (student-recruiter interactions). 

- Student: "At the job fair, I stood in line 40 minutes just to hand over my résumé."
- Recruiter: "We meet hundreds of students in a single afternoon. After a while, names and faces blur together."
- Some recruiters use spreadsheets during the fair to jot notes about students: "Has Python," "Strong communication," "Not ready."
- Student frustration: "I never know if recruiters actually looked at my résumé or if it went into a pile."
- Recruiter: "We usually contact students weeks later, but many either lose interest or already have offers by then."
- Students often rely on school provided career services for résumé templates, but recruiters say they "all look the same."
- Recruiters: "We prefer quick ways to identify students with the right skills rather than going résumé by résumé."
- Informal hallway conversations sometimes lead to opportunities, students value those more than formal booths.
- Some recruiters only target juniors and seniors, ignoring freshmen.
- Student: "I’m nervous approaching a recruiter if I don’t already know about the company."
- Recruiters say a lot of students come unprepared, don’t know what positions are open.
- Student: "I applied through Handshake, LinkedIn, and the company website. Did they even see my application?"
- Recruiter: "We’re under pressure to find talent quickly. If the first batch of candidates looks good, we stop looking."
- Some recruiters mention re-hiring interns they already know -> "trust factor."
- Students compare the process to "speed dating", due to quick, superficial interactions.
- Recruiters complain they can’t gauge "soft skills" (teamwork, communication) in the short job fair chats.
- Student: "I wish I knew immediately if I had a chance instead of waiting months."
- Job fairs are often loud, crowded, chaotic -> recruiters and students both stressed.
- Some recruiters hand out swag -> students often remember the company by this.
- Students sometimes attend fairs "just to practice talking" rather than actually seeking jobs.
- Recruiters: "We’d like to pre screen students before the fair to save time."

==== Terminology

==== Domain Terminology in Relation to Domain Rough Sketch

==== Narrative

The domain concerns how employers identify, evaluate, and hire talent, and how job seekers explore and compare opportunities. In this context, the term “candidate” is used broadly to mean any person seeking a job, regardless of prior experience or stage of career. The observable world of the domain includes candidates with educational and employment histories, competencies, and preferences; employers with staffing needs and hiring calendars; recruiters who operate search and prioritization criteria; openings defined by requirements, number of positions, and relevant dates; application documents such as résumés, certifications, portfolios, and references; and recruitment events with agendas and limited capacity. Information circulates through common channels such as postings, professional networks, referrals, unions, and agencies, under rules of eligibility and time availability.

A typical cycle begins when an employer defines and disseminates a vacancy with explicit requirements, for example minimum experience, qualifications, licenses or certifications, languages, and legal authorizations, together with job conditions such as work modality, location, reference compensation, and start date. Candidates discover these opportunities, compare requirements to their profile, and express interest. Reciprocally, recruiters may pursue profiles based on observable signals such as track record, achievements, work samples, or references. Eligibility verification precedes any advance. Based on that verification and perceived fit, shortlists are formed and, when appropriate, additional screenings are conducted, including technical or psychometric tests. Interviews are scheduled in non-overlapping time slots, held in person or virtually, and conclude with observations that inform later decisions.

When there is sufficient correspondence between needs and demonstrated capabilities, the employer issues an offer with explicit terms and a validity period. Clarifications or adjustments may follow, after which the candidate accepts or declines within the stated deadline. In parallel, recruitment events concentrate interactions: an audience is convened, capacity is managed, attendance is confirmed, and participation is recorded. From these contacts, new expressions of interest and applications can emerge without a prior formal submission. Relevant information, including requirements, application states, evaluations, schedules, and event capacity, shows varying degrees of structure, which explains asymmetries and information overload on both sides.

The domain is governed by stable rules: each search process ties recruiters to a specific employer; candidates and openings relate in a many-to-many manner through applications; applications do not advance without meeting minimum requirements; no person is assigned to overlapping interviews; attendance at an event consumes available capacity; and offers expire if no response is received within their validity period. Cyclical patterns also exist, with posting and closing windows that shape supply, participation, and acceptance decisions. This description reflects how the labor market operates, independent of any system to be built.
