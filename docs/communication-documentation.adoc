*Status:* Closed | *Urgency:* 5 | *Difficulty:* 4  

Define the full swipe → match → chat flow, listing all actors and services.

*Status:* Closed | *Urgency:* 6 | *Difficulty:* 5  

Conduct recruiter research via interviews or desk studies.  
Synthesize findings into a Jobs-To-Be-Done analysis, an event/channel matrix, and a MoSCoW-prioritized list of 5–7 requirements ready for implementation.

*Status:* Closed | *Urgency:* 6 | *Difficulty:* 5  

Produce a research packet on implementing real-time push and in-app notifications using Flutter and Supabase.

=== #120: Research: Data Privacy Compliance
*Status:* Closed | *Urgency:* 5 | *Difficulty:* 5  

Identify data privacy laws relevant to messaging and notifications.  
Map data flows, specify compliance checks (lawful basis, minimization, retention, user rights, transfers, breach response), and support findings with authoritative regulations.


=== #155: Documentation Improvements (Tracking Issue)
*Status:* Open | *Urgency:* 3 | *Difficulty:* 3  

Coordinate all documentation updates for Milestone 2 across Sections 1–3.  
Ensure consistency in synopsis, terminology, narratives, user stories, requirements, SOLID principles, and validation strategy.  
Use AsciiDoc change marks and log all edits in the documentation logbook.


=== #161: Sub-Section Revision: Narrative (2.1.4)
*Status:* Closed | *Urgency:* 3 | *Difficulty:* 4  

Revise the domain narrative by combining abstract concepts with concrete examples.  
Clarify relationships, edge cases, and ensure internal consistency with related sections using AsciiDoc formatting.

*Status:* Closed | *Urgency:* 3 | *Difficulty:* 3  

Refactor the section to clearly separate Epics, Features, and User Stories (“As a…, I want…, so that…”).  
Ensure traceability from user stories → features → requirements and maintain proper AsciiDoc formatting.


=== #227: Continuous Refactoring Log
*Status:* Closed | *Urgency:* 5 | *Difficulty:* 4  

Maintain a living log documenting refactorings that clarify and deepen the domain model.  
Each entry includes a trigger, domain insight, performed refactor, and resulting invariants.  
At least five dated entries are required, two linking to updated diagrams or docs, with CI validation for all referenced changes.



== Carlos Pepin (carlospepin23)
=== #228: Model Address as a Value Object and Integrate into StudentProfile 
*Status:* Closed | *Urgency:* 4 | *Difficulty:* 4  

This issue required modeling “Address” as a Value Object within the StudentProfile aggregate to improve domain integrity and consistency.  
Instead of using separate primitive fields (street, city, zip, etc.), the task created a cohesive, immutable Address object with value-based equality.  
The change replaced the old address fields in StudentProfile with the new Address Value Object and updated DTOs and persistence mappings for compatibility.  



== Diego Pérez (diegoperez16)
=== #94: Aggregate Deletion Rules
*Status:* Closed | *Urgency:* 5  |  *Difficulty:* 5 

Ensured cascade deletion for `StudentProfile`, removing related `Match`, `Application`, and `MentorAssignment` records to prevent orphan data.
