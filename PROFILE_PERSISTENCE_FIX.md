# Profile Data Persistence Fix

## Issue
After clicking "Profile" in the Settings screen, the profile forms did not display the user's data that was entered during signup. Profile data was not being saved or loaded.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Extended Storage Service
**File**: `lib/core/services/storage_service.dart`

Added methods to save and retrieve profile data:
- `saveRecruiterProfile(RecruiterProfile)` - Save recruiter profile to local storage
- `getRecruiterProfile()` - Retrieve recruiter profile from local storage
- `saveJobSeekerProfile(JobSeekerProfile)` - Save job seeker profile to local storage
- `getJobSeekerProfile()` - Retrieve job seeker profile from local storage
- `clearProfiles()` - Clear all profile data

### 2. Updated Recruiter Profile Screen
**File**: `lib/features/profiles/recruiter_profile/recruiter_profile_screen.dart`

Changes:
- Added `_storageService` instance
- Added `_isLoading` state to handle async data loading
- Created `_loadProfile()` method that:
  - Gets current user from AuthCubit
  - Loads saved profile from storage
  - Pre-populates form with existing data
- Updated `_onSave()` to:
  - Save profile data to local storage
  - Show success message
- Wrapped UI in `BlocBuilder` to access authenticated user info
- Added loading indicator while data loads
- Display user's name and email in subtitle

### 3. Updated Job Seeker Profile Screen
**File**: `lib/features/profiles/jobseeker_profile/jobseeker_profile_screen.dart`

Changes:
- Added `_storageService` instance  
- Added `_isLoading` state for async operations
- Created `_loadProfile()` method that:
  - Loads saved profile from storage
  - Uses existing `ctrl.loadFromModel()` to populate form fields
- Updated `_onSave()` to:
  - Create profile model with current user ID
  - Save to local storage
  - Show success message
- Wrapped UI in `BlocBuilder` to access authenticated user
- Added loading indicator during data load
- Display user's name and email in description

### 4. Fixed Dependencies
**File**: `pubspec.yaml`

Added missing dependencies:
- `flutter_bloc: ^8.1.6` - For state management with Cubits
- `equatable: ^2.0.5` - For value equality in states
- `flutter_dotenv: ^5.1.0` - For environment variables

### 5. Updated Main App
**File**: `lib/main.dart`

- Properly imported `flutter_dotenv`
- Integrated `BlocProvider` with `AuthCubit`
- Connected router with auth state management
- Fixed dotenv usage

### 6. Updated App Router
**File**: `lib/routes/app_router.dart`

- Added `createRouter()` method that accepts AuthCubit
- Implemented auth-based redirects
- Added refresh listener for auth state changes
- Added routes for Welcome and Main screens

### 7. Added Route Constants
**File**: `lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart`

Added missing route constants:
- `welcomeRoute` - '/welcome'
- `mainRoute` - '/main'  
- `settingsRoute` - '/settings'

## How It Works

### Profile Save Flow:
1. User fills out profile form
2. Clicks save button (FAB)
3. Form data is validated
4. Profile model is created with user ID from AuthCubit
5. Profile is saved to SharedPreferences via StorageService
6. Success message is shown

### Profile Load Flow:
1. User navigates to Profile screen from Settings
2. Screen initializes with loading state
3. `_loadProfile()` is called:
   - Retrieves saved profile from StorageService
   - If profile exists, populates form fields
   - If no profile, shows empty form
4. Loading state is cleared, form is displayed
5. User sees their previously saved data

## Data Persistence

Profile data is stored locally using `SharedPreferences` with these keys:
- `recruiter_profile` - JSON string of RecruiterProfile
- `jobseeker_profile` - JSON string of JobSeekerProfile

Data persists across:
- ✅ App restarts
- ✅ Navigation between screens
- ✅ Logout/login cycles (until explicitly cleared)

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. **Sign up** as Job Seeker or Recruiter
2. **Fill out profile** with test data
3. **Click save** (check mark FAB)
4. **Navigate away** (back button or settings)
5. **Go to Settings** → **Profile**
6. **Verify** all data is still there
7. **Close and reopen app**
8. **Check profile** - data should persist

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Sync profile data with backend API
- [ ] Add profile image upload capability
- [ ] Implement profile completeness indicator
- [ ] Add validation for required vs optional fields
- [ ] Auto-save drafts periodically
- [ ] Cloud backup of profile data
- [ ] Profile export/import functionality
